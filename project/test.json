[{"0": "The Iago sparrow (Passer iagoensis), also known as the Cape Verde or rufous-backed sparrow, is a passerine bird of the sparrow family Passeridae. It is endemic to the Cape Verde archipelago, in the eastern Atlantic Ocean near western Africa. Females and young birds have brown plumage with black marks above, and a dull grey underside, and are distinguished from other species of sparrow by their large, distinct supercilium. Males have a brighter underside and bold black and chestnut stripes on their head. At 12.5\u201313 centimetres (4.9\u20135.1\u00a0in) long, it is a smaller sparrow. This bird's vocalisations are mostly variations on its chirp, which differ somewhat between males and females."}, {"0": "The Iago sparrow was once thought to be most closely related to the rufous sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar habitats on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow is closest to the rufous sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more closely related to the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most of the habitats that are available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List."}, {"0": "The Iago sparrow is a small sparrow, 12.5\u201313 centimetres (4.9\u20135.1\u00a0in) long, with a wing length of 5.5\u20136.9 centimetres (2.2\u20132.7\u00a0in).[3] Its plumage is similar to that of the house sparrow, and it similarly is sexually dimorphic. The male has a black or greyish-black crown and eyestripe, a grey nape and a small patch of white on the lower forehead. The sides of its head, especially above the eye, are a rich cinnamon colour. The scapulars are white and brown, while the rest of the upperparts are brown, streaked with black and beige. The cheeks and underparts are pale grey, and the throat and chin are marked with a small black bib. The female is grey-brown, with black-streaked wings and breast, and pale grey underparts. It is very similar to the female house sparrow but has a more apparent pale supercilium (stripe over the eye). The juvenile resembles the adult female, but young males are more chestnut from an early age, with a trace of a black bib on the chin.[3][4] In 1898, ornithologist Boyd Alexander reported that adults begin moulting in early February, and some birds were still in moult by late May.[5][6]"}, {"0": "The Iago sparrow's vocalisations include calls, varying between the sexes, elaborations of these called 'songs', and an alarm call. Calls are chirps, somewhat similar to those of other sparrows, the usual version made by males described as a \"twangy\" cheesp or chew-weep, and that of females described as a \"more sibilant\" chisk. The song is a long, elaborated series of call notes, and is made by breeding males in their nests. An alarm call like that of other sparrows, transcribed chur-chur-chur, is also used.[6]"}, {"0": "The Iago sparrow was first collected by Charles Darwin during the first stop of the second voyage of HMS Beagle at the island of Santiago (St. Iago).[2] It was described for him in 1837 by zoologist John Gould, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, and given the name of Pyrgita iagoensis.[7] By the time Gould wrote The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle with Darwin and three other zoologists in 1841, he had placed the Iago sparrow in the genus Passer, where it remains.[2][4] The genus, among the sparrows of the Old World in the family Passeridae, also contains at least 20 other species, among them the house sparrow and Eurasian tree sparrow.[8]"}, {"0": "Within its genus, the Iago sparrow has been considered one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland rufous sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis.[2] This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and separation from the other rufous sparrows by about 5,000 kilometres (3,100\u00a0mi), are sufficient grounds for species status.[2][8][9] Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the rufous sparrows.[10]"}, {"0": "French ornithologist \u00c9mile Oustalet described a specimen from Branco as a separate species Passer brancoensis in 1883,[2][11] which was recognised as the subspecies Passer iagoensis brancoensis by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands.[12] According to Bourne, birds of Passer iagoensis iagoensis on more wooded islands in the south are darker and larger, and also behave more like house or Spanish sparrows, competing with them better in human-altered habitats.[12] He later wrote that the variations he saw comprised two clinal trends, of increasing darkness towards the south, and of smaller size further from the continental coast.[13] Charles Vaurie, examining differences in plumage and measurements of specimens in major museums, did not find any significant variation, and neither Vaurie nor Summers-Smith recognised any subspecies.[2][14]"}, {"0": "The Iago sparrow is endemic to the archipelago of Cape Verde. It is common on most islands, excluding Fogo (from which it is absent) and Santa Luzia, Branco and Sal (on which it is scarce).[3][15] The Iago sparrow is found commonly in a variety of habitats, including flat lava plains, coastal cliffs, gorges, and the edges of farmland, at altitudes of up to 1,200 metres (3,900\u00a0ft). It also occurs in settled areas and gardens, where it may overlap somewhat with the house sparrow, but usually not with the Spanish sparrow. The Spanish sparrow occurs in richer cultivated land with larger trees and villages, restricting the Iago sparrow to more arid cultivated land with smaller trees. In settlements where both the house sparrow and Iago sparrow occur, house sparrows tend to occupy the denser areas, while Iago sparrows are found primarily around trees and open spaces.[16] In agricultural areas the Iago sparrow may do some damage to crops, mostly by eating buds and shoots.[3] The Iago sparrow is highly common within its limited range, though its exact population is not known. Though the size of its range means it may be at risk to unpredicted changes in its environment, it is assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.[1]"}, {"0": "In May 2013 four vagrant Iago sparrows were seen at Hansweert, in the Netherlands, having flown onto a ship as it passed by the island of Raso.[17]"}, {"0": "The Iago sparrow is gregarious while foraging and breeding. Outside of the breeding season, Iago sparrows are always in flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler.[18][19] The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest.[18] Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear.[17][20] Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.[18]"}, {"0": "The adult Iago sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps available near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans.[5][6][21] The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.[18]"}, {"0": "The breeding season generally begins in August and September with the onset of the humid season, but the climate during a particular year may change the timing of breeding. On Cima, W. R. P. Bourne observed females remaining in flocks while males began to take up locations on rocky slopes from which they could sing. The breeding season is typically long enough that some pairs may be fledging young before others even start to build a nest; the greatest number of pairs breed when rains come, in October to November. Unmated males attract females by calling out beside a prospective nest site. When approached by a female, the displaying male will increase the intensity of his calls and hop around her while crouching with chestnut rump- and shoulder-feathers exposed. The male begins building the nest, but once a pair is formed both birds of the pair participate in the nest's construction and remain close together.[12][18] Copulation occurs after the nest has been constructed, while the female is dominant in the pair for a time. The male invites the female to copulate by giving the crouching courtship display, and after ignoring and pecking at him initially, the female solicits copulation by crouching herself. When four vagrants were in the Netherlands in May 2013, a male was seen mounting a second male, apparently after the second crouched submissively to resolve a fight between them. This is the only recorded case of homosexual behaviour in sparrows.[22]"}, {"0": "Nests are usually built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, although sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may be built in a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for compactness. Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but these records may reflect confusion with the Spanish sparrow.[18] The average clutch contains three to five eggs.[3] Both sexes incubate the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males incubate for shorter periods and less often. Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and brings it to their nestlings, he less often brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.[18]"}, {"0": "The Ibadan malimbe (Malimbus ibadanensis) is a rare species of bird in the family Ploceidae."}, {"0": "It is endemic to Nigeria, where it is known only from the southwestern part of the country, including the city of Ibadan (in Oyo) which it is named after.

It was not historically a rare species within a suitable habitat, but the total population probably never numbered more than 8,000 individuals (Lammertink et al. 1996). Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals) based on the lack of confirmed records since 1956; analyses of remaining habitats indicate that no tracts remain which are large enough to support the species. The last confirmed record was from Durango in 1956 and the species is very likely now extinct. If they have gone extinct, it would have been due to habitat destruction and fragmentation combined with hunting. These factors are the reason why the species has not been seen in over 60 years, although there have been local reports of sightings. Researchers believe that their decline was also accelerated by active eradication campaigns conducted by logging interests and by over-hunting \u2014 for use in folk medicine and because nestlings were considered a delicacy by the Tarahumara. It has been hunted for sport, food and for medicinal purposes over a long period of time and feathers and bills were reportedly used in rituals by the Tepheuana and Huichol tribes in the south of Durango.

There are a handful of more recent, unconfirmed sightings,[6] the most recent of which closely followed the 2005 publication of the purported rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker. Lammertink et al. (1996), after extensively reviewing post-1956 reports, conclude that the species did indeed survive into the 1990s in the central part of its range, but also consider its continued survival very unlikely. According to them, the population was always restricted in historic times, although the species was indeed present in maximum density before a catastrophic decline during the 1950s. The lack of good records from that time is apparently based more on lack of research than on actual rarity, but this seems to have changed radically only one decade later.[3]"}, {"0": "Field research by Tim Gallagher and Martjan Lammertink, reported in Gallagher's 2013 book, found evidence \u2014 in the form of accounts by elderly residents in the bird's range who saw imperial woodpeckers decades earlier and who discussed their recollections with the researchers \u2014 that foresters working with Mexican logging companies in the 1950s told the local people that the woodpeckers were destroying valuable timber and encouraged the people to kill the birds. As part of this campaign, the foresters gave the local residents poison to smear on trees that the birds foraged on. Because groups of imperial woodpeckers tended to feed on a single huge, dead, old-growth pine tree for as long as two weeks, applying poison to such a tree would be an effective way to wipe out a group of up to one dozen of these huge woodpeckers \u2014 and, perhaps, even to kill off succeeding groups of the birds that might move into the area and be attracted to the same tree. Gallagher suspects that such a campaign of poisoning may be the key to the species' apparent catastrophic population crash in the 1950s, which has hitherto lacked a satisfactory explanation. A campaign of poisoning could well have killed whole groups of the bird in a short time. The premise of protecting valuable timber from the woodpeckers was, in fact, baseless.

The Inaccessible Island rail's affinities and origin were a long-standing mystery; in 2018 its closest relative was identified as the South American dot-winged crake (Porzana spiloptera), and it was proposed that both species should be nested within the genus Laterallus.[3][4][5]"}, {"0": "A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage, black bill and feet, and adults have a red eye.

When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.[6]"}, {"0": "Another attempt was made to collect a specimen by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905.

This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species.[7] He did so, briefly, at a meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.[2]"}, {"0": "Prior to its collection it had been assumed by Thomson that the species was close to the other \"island hens\" known in the Atlantic, possibly a gallinule,[6] but on examination Lowe felt \"compelled to refer it to a new genus\".[8] The generic name Atlantisia was named for the mythical island of Atlantis, destroyed by a volcano. The specific name rogersi honours the Rev. Rogers, who collected and sent the first specimens of the species to Lowe.[9]"}, {"0": "In his 1928 paper on the species, Lowe thought the Inaccessible Island rail was the descendant of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria.[7][10] Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of plate tectonics.[11] By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also presumed that like most other land birds of the Tristan Archipelago (except the Tristan moorhen Gallinula nesiotis and the Gough moorhen G. comeri[12]), it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.[10]"}, {"0": "The position of the Inaccessible Island rail in the larger rail family (Rallidae) has long been a source of uncertainty. Lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been black crake of Africa, or perhaps an early offshoot of the genus Porphyrio (swamphens), a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage. He did concede that it was difficult to assign the rail to any relatives.[7] American paleontologist Storrs Olson suggested in 1973 that it was related to the \"Rallus assemblage\", which included the genera Rallus and Hypotaenidia (now lumped with Gallirallus), based on the structure of the skeleton. In particular he suggested it was part of a pro-Rallus group that included the Indian Ocean genus Dryolimnas, and the Australasian Lewinia. Olson suggested the pro-Rallus rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in Africa and South America, where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from.[13] The most recent comparative morphological study to include the genus, in 1998, placed it in a subtribe Crecina of the crakes. Its exact position could not be determined, but it was suggested to perhaps be the sister taxon to the genus Laterallus, a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America.[14][4]"}, {"0": "Two extinct flightless species of rail were at one time placed in the genus Atlantisia with the Inaccessible Island rail. The Ascension crake (Mundia elpenor) and the Saint Helena swamphen (Aphanocrex podarces) were once considered congeners of A. rogersi. The Ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 and has never been encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric.[13] Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Both the Ascension crake and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.[15]"}, {"0": "Stervander et al.

Males are larger and heavier than females, weighing 35\u201349\u00a0g (1.2\u20131.7\u00a0oz), average 40.5\u00a0g (1.43\u00a0oz), compared to 34\u201342\u00a0g (1.2\u20131.5\u00a0oz), average 37\u00a0g (1.3\u00a0oz), in females. It is dark chestnut-brown above and dark grey on the head and below, with degraded white barring on the flanks and belly, and adults have a red eye. The female is similar to the male but with paler grey and a faint brown wash on the underparts. It has a black bill, which is shorter than the head.[7] The feathers of the Inaccessible Island rail are almost hair-like, and in particular the flight feathers are degenerate, as the barbules on many of the feathers (but not all, as has sometimes been reported) fail to interlock, giving the feathers a ragged appearance.[16] The wings are reduced and weak, and smaller than same-sized flying relatives, as is the sternum. The tail is short, 3.5\u00a0cm (1.4\u00a0in) in length, and the uppertail coverts and undertail coverts are nearly as long as the tail rectrices.[7]"}, {"0": "The Inaccessible Island rail has a low basal metabolic rate (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60\u201368% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not as a result of flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness.[17] A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.[18]"}, {"0": "The Inaccessible rail is endemic to the uninhabited Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group in the mid-Atlantic Ocean.[19] The island is 14\u00a0km2 (5.4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds.[20] The rail is found in almost all habitats on the island and at all altitudes, from sea-level to 449\u00a0m (1,473\u00a0ft). It reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass (Spartina arundinacea), with 10 birds per hectare, and in tussock grass mixed with ferns (Blechnum penna-marina) and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare.[21] This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs.[20] The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns (Blechnum palmiforme) and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle (Phylica arborea)\u2014which can reach 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) where sheltered\u2014and Blechnum palmiforme.[20] In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare.[21] It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the cinder cones (the scientists making the observations cautioned that this does not mean that they never use the habitat).[21] It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.[19]"}, {"0": "The Inaccessible Island rail is territorial, and the territories they defend are tiny.

The small size of the territories makes encounters between families and individuals frequent, and confrontations and territorial calling are common. On meeting, confrontations start with loud trills or twittering, then birds may face off, standing very close to each other and displaying ritually with their heads lowered and their bills pointed towards the ground. They may circle, and continue displaying until one bird slowly retreats or a quick skirmish ensues and one bird is driven off.[21]"}, {"0": "The foraging method used by the Inaccessible Island rail is slow and deliberate and has been compared to that of a mouse, and the bird occupies a similar ecological niche.[19] They feed on a range of invertebrates, including earthworms, amphipods, isopods, mites and a range of insects such as beetles, flies, moths and caterpillars. Centipedes are taken as well, and an introduced species of centipede forms an important part of their diet. Along with animal prey they will take the berries of Empetrum and Nertera as well as the seeds of the dock Rumex. Unlike the Tristan thrush they do not feed on carrion or dead fish.[19]"}, {"0": "The Inaccessible Island rail is a highly vocal species, calling frequently. This may be because of the dense vegetation the species lives in, making calls the best way to communicate, and pairs and families contact call frequently while feeding. Calls used include a long trill used when pairs meet and when confronting a rival.[19][21] Rivals also make a long twitter \"keekeekeekeekee\" which can be long and short and end in a \"keekeechitrrrr\". After skirmishes between rivals the victorious bird may make a \"weechup weechup\" call. Birds may make a monotonous \"tchik tchik tchok tchik\" while hunting for prey, and the alarm call when predators are around is a short and hard \"chip\". They also make a variety of trilling calls while incubating, particularly when pairs swap places during incubation. Before changing places the incubating bird may make a \"chip chip chip\", but they fall silent when Tristan thrushes approach the nest.[21]"}, {"0": "The Inaccessible Island rail is a seasonal breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are situated at the base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).[21]"}, {"0": "The clutch size is two eggs, which is low for such small rails.[18] The eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve spots that are concentrated around the apex of the egg.

They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen.[23] After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent.[21] Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause of death.[19]"}, {"0": "Two species of chewing lice have been found on Inaccessible Island rails, Pscudomenopon scopulacorne and Rallicola (Parricola) zumpti.

In many parts of northern India, they are protected by religious practices and will forage around villages and towns for scraps. Some have suggested that the peacock was introduced into Europe by Alexander the Great,[21] while others say the bird had reached Athens by 450 BCE and may have been introduced even earlier.[22] It has since been introduced in many other parts of the world and has become feral in some areas.[11]"}, {"0": "The Indian peafowl has been introduced to the United States, the United Kingdom,[23] Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Madagascar, Mauritius, R\u00e9union, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, Croatia and the island of Lokrum.[24]"}, {"0": "The first whole-genome sequencing of Indian peafowl identified a total of 15,970 protein-coding sequences, along with 213 tRNAs, 236 snoRNAs, and 540 miRNAs.

PSMC analysis suggested that the peacock suffered at least two bottlenecks (around four million years ago and again 450,000 years ago), which resulted in a severe reduction in its effective population size.[25]"}, {"0": "Peafowl are best known for the male's extravagant display feathers which, despite actually growing from their back, are thought of as a tail. The \"train\" is in reality made up of the enormously elongated upper tail coverts. The tail itself is brown and short as in the peahen. The colours result not from any green or blue pigments but from the micro-structure of the feathers and the resulting optical phenomena.[26] The long train feathers (and tarsal spurs) of the male develop only after the second year of life. Fully developed trains are found in birds older than four years. In northern India, these begin to develop each February and are moulted at the end of August.[27] The moult of the flight feathers may be spread out across the year.[28]"}, {"0": "Peafowl forage on the ground in small groups, known as musters, that usually have a cock and 3 to 5 hens. After the breeding season, the flocks tend to be made up only of females and young. They are found in the open early in the mornings and tend to stay in cover during the heat of the day. They are fond of dust-bathing and at dusk, groups walk in single file to a favourite waterhole to drink. When disturbed, they usually escape by running and rarely take to flight.[11]"}, {"0": "Peafowl produce loud calls especially in the breeding season.

In the Gir forest, they chose tall trees in steep river banks.[30][31] Birds arrive at dusk and call frequently before taking their position on the roost trees.[32] Due to this habit of congregating at the roost, many population studies are made at these sites. The population structure is not well understood. In a study in northern India (Jodhpur), the number of males was 170\u2013210 for 100 females but a study involving evening counts at the roost site in southern India (Injar) suggested a ratio of 47 males for 100 females.[12]"}, {"0": "The colours of the peacock and the contrast with the much duller peahen were a puzzle to early thinkers. Charles Darwin wrote to Asa Gray that the \"sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!\" as he failed to see an adaptive advantage for the extravagant tail which seemed only to be an encumbrance. Darwin developed a second principle of sexual selection to resolve the problem, though in the prevailing intellectual trends of Victorian Britain, the theory failed to gain widespread attention.[33]"}, {"0": "The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer tried to show, from his own imagination, the value of the eyespots as disruptive camouflage in a 1907 painting.[34] He used the painting in his 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, denying the possibility of sexual selection and arguing that essentially all forms of animal colouration had evolved as camouflage.[35] He was roundly criticised in a lengthy paper by Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote that Thayer had only managed to paint the peacock's plumage as camouflage by sleight of hand, \"with the blue sky showing through the leaves in just sufficient quantity here and there to warrant the author-artists explaining that the wonderful blue hues of the peacock's neck are obliterative because they make it fade into the sky.\"[36]"}, {"0": "In the 1970s a possible resolution to the apparent contradiction between natural selection and sexual selection was proposed. Amotz Zahavi argued that peacocks honestly signalled the handicap of having a large and costly train.

Males use their ornate trains in a courtship display: they raise the feathers into a fan and quiver them. However, recent studies have failed to find a relation between the number of displayed eyespots and mating success.[39] Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signaled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. She showed that the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success, and this success could be manipulated by cutting the eyespots off some of the male's ornate feathers.[40]"}, {"0": "Although the removal of eyespots makes males less successful in mating,[40] eyespot removal substantially changes the appearance of male peafowls. It is likely that females mistake these males for sub-adults, or perceive that the males are physically damaged. Moreover, in a feral peafowl population, there is little variation in the number of eyespots in adult males. It is rare for adult males to lose a significant number of eyespots. Therefore, females' selection might depend on other sexual traits of males' trains. The quality of train is an honest signal of the condition of males; peahens do select males on the basis of their plumage. A recent study on a natural population of Indian peafowls in the Shivalik area of India has proposed a \"high maintenance handicap\" theory. It states that only the fittest males can afford the time and energy to maintain a long tail. Therefore, the long train is an indicator of good body condition, which results in greater mating success.[41] While train length seems to correlate positively with MHC diversity in males, females do not appear to use train length to choose males.[42] A study in Japan also suggests that peahens do not choose peacocks based on their ornamental plumage, including train length, number of eyespots and train symmetry.[43] Another study in France brings up two possible explanations for the conflicting results that exist. The first explanation is that there might be a genetic variation of the trait of interest under different geographical areas due to a founder effect and/or a genetic drift. The second explanation suggests that \"the cost of trait expression may vary with environmental conditions,\" so that a trait that is indicative of a particular quality may not work in another environment.[40]"}, {"0": "Fisher's runaway model proposes positive feedback between female preference for elaborate trains and the elaborate train itself. This model assumes that the male train is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation. However, a molecular phylogeny study on peacock-pheasants shows the opposite; the most recently evolved species is actually the least ornamented one.[44] This finding suggests a chase-away sexual selection, in which \"females evolve resistance to male ploys\".[45] A study in Japan goes on to conclude that the \"peacocks' train is an obsolete signal for which female preference has already been lost or weakened\".[43]"}, {"0": "However, some disagreement has arisen in recent years concerning whether or not female peafowl do indeed select males with more ornamented trains. In contrast to Petrie's findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl came to the conclusion that female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens expressed any preference for peacocks with more elaborate trains (such as trains having more ocelli), a more symmetrical arrangement, or a greater length.[43] Takahashi determined that the peacock's train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and, based on physiological data collected from this group of peafowl, do not correlate to male physical conditions. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded to Takahashi's study by voicing concern that alternative explanations for these results had been overlooked, and that these might be essential for the understanding of the complexity of mate choice.[40] They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions."}, {"0": "A 2013 study that tracked the eye movements of peahens responding to male displays found that they looked in the direction of the upper train of feathers only when at long distances and that they looked only at the lower feathers when males displayed close to them.

Peafowls usually reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years old.[47] Several males may congregate at a lek site and these males are often closely related.[48] Males at leks appear to maintain small territories next to each other and they allow females to visit them and make no attempt to guard harems. Females do not appear to favour specific males.[49] The males display in courtship by raising the upper-tail coverts into an arched fan. The wings are held half open and drooped and it periodically vibrates the long feathers, producing a ruffling sound. The cock faces the hen initially and struts and prances around and sometimes turns around to display the tail.[11] Males may also freeze over food to invite a female in a form of courtship feeding.[50] Males may display even in the absence of females. When a male is displaying, females do not appear to show any interest and usually continue their foraging.[12]"}, {"0": "The peak season in southern India is April to May, January to March in Sri Lanka and June in northern India.

A 2006 study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both ivory-billed woodpeckers, along with the imperial woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis), a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded not only that the Cuban and American ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also that they and the imperial form a North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the mid-Pleistocene.[17] The study does not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, although it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the imperial.[17] The American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature has said it is not yet ready to list the American and Cuban birds as separate species. Lovette, a member of the committee, said that more testing is needed to support that change, but concluded, \"These results will likely initiate an interesting debate on how we should classify these birds.\"[18]"}, {"0": "\"Ivory-billed woodpecker\" is the official name given to the species by the International Ornithologists' Union.[19] Older common names included Log Cock, Log God, Good Lord Bird, Indian Hen, Kent, Kate, Poule de Bois (Wood Hen in Cajun French),[20] and Tit-ka (Wood Cock in Seminole).[21][22] Some modern authors refer to the species as the \"Holy Grail bird\" or \"Grail Bird\" because of its extreme rarity and elusiveness to birders.[23]"}, {"0": "The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of the largest woodpeckers in the world at roughly 51 centimetres (20\u00a0in; 1.67\u00a0ft) long and 76 centimetres (30\u00a0in; 2.49\u00a0ft) in wingspan. It is the largest woodpecker in its range. The closely related imperial woodpecker (C. imperialis) of western Mexico is the largest woodpecker in the world.

There are white lines extending from the cheeks down the neck, meeting on the back. The ends of the inner primary feathers are white, as well as the whole of the outer secondary feathers.[25] This creates extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper- and underwing. The underwing also is white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. Some birds have been recorded with more extensive amounts of white on the primary feathers.[26] Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although it is ragged in juveniles. The bird is somewhat sexually dimorphic, as seen in the image to the right, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear in males, but solid black in females, as well as in juvenile males. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both genders present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, while it is chalky white in juveniles. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel. Its flight is strong and direct, and has been likened to that of a duck."}, {"0": "These characteristics distinguish ivory-bills from the smaller and darker-billed pileated woodpecker. The pileated woodpecker normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but normally its back is black. Pileated woodpecker juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileated woodpeckers normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white on each side of the body, near the edge of the wing. However, aberrant individual pileated woodpeckers have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched."}, {"0": "The drum of the ivory-billed woodpecker is a single or double rap. Four fairly distinct calls are reported in the literature and two were recorded in the 1930s. The most common, a kent or hant, sounds like a toy trumpet often repeated in a series.

A conversational call, also recorded, is given between individuals at the nest, and has been described as kent-kent-kent."}, {"0": "No attempts to comprehensively estimate the range of the ivory-billed woodpecker were made until after its range already had been severely reduced by deforestation and hunting. The first range map produced for the species was made by Edwin M. Hasbrouck in 1891.[27] The second range map produced was that made by James Tanner in 1942.[28] Both authors reconstructed the original range of the species from historical records they considered reliable, in many cases from specimens with clear records of where they were obtained. The two authors produced broadly similar range estimates, finding that before deforestation and hunting began to shrink its range, the ivory-billed woodpecker had ranged from eastern Texas to North Carolina, and from southern Illinois to Florida and Cuba,[29] typically from the coast inland to where the elevation is approximately 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).[30]"}, {"0": "A few significant differences in their reconstructions exist, however. Based on the reports of Wells Woodbridge Cooke from Kansas City and Fayette, Hasbrouck's range map extended up the Missouri River and approximately to Kansas City.[31] which Tanner rejected as a possible accidental or unproven report.[32] Similarly, Hasbrouck's range estimate extended up the Ohio River Valley to Franklin County, Indiana, based on a record from the E. T. Cox,[33] which Tanner likewise rejected as unproven or accidental. Tanner's range estimate extended farther up the Arkansas River and Canadian River, on the basis of reports of the birds by S. W. Woodhouse west of Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Edwin James at the falls of the Canadian River,[34] which were not mentioned by, and possibly unknown to, Hasbrouck."}, {"0": "Tanner's range map is now generally accepted as the original range of the bird,[28] but a number of records exist outside of both ranges, that were either overlooked or rejected by Tanner, or that surfaced after his analysis. Southwest of Tanner's range estimate, the species was reported along the San Marcos River and Guadalupe River, as well as near New Braunfels, around 1900.[35] Farther along the Ohio River Valley, William Fleming reported shooting an ivory-billed woodpecker at Logan's Fort, Kentucky in 1780.[36] Ivory-billed woodpecker remains were found in middens in Scioto County, Ohio, and were inferred to come from a bird locally hunted.[37] Similar inferences were drawn from remains found near Wheeling, West Virginia.[38] There is also a report of a bird shot and eaten in Doddridge County, West Virginia, around 1900.[39] Based on reports that did not include specimens, Hasbrouck set the northern limit of the range along the Atlantic Coast to around Fort Macon, North Carolina,[40] which was rejected as unproven by Tanner, who used the record of a bird shot 12 miles (19\u00a0km) north of Wilmington, North Carolina, by Alexander Wilson to set the northern limit of the range.[32]"}, {"0": "Records exist of the ivory-billed woodpecker farther north along the Atlantic Coast; Thomas Jefferson included it as a bird of Virginia in Notes on the State of Virginia, where it is listed as the \"White bill woodpecker\" with the designation of Picus principalis.[41][42] Audubon reported the bird could occasionally be found as far north as Maryland.[43] Pehr Kalm reported it was present seasonally in Swedesboro, New Jersey in the mid-18th century.[44] Farther inland, Wilson reported shooting an ivory-bill west of Winchester, Virginia.[39] Bones recovered from the Etowah Mounds in Georgia are generally believed to come from birds hunted locally.[35] Within its range, the ivory-billed woodpecker is not smoothly distributed, but highly locally concentrated in areas where the habitat is suitable and where large quantities of appropriate food may be found.[28]"}, {"0": "Knowledge of the ecology and behavior of ivory-billed woodpeckers is largely derived from James Tanner's study of several birds in a tract of forest along the Tensas River in the late 1930s. The extent to which those data can be extrapolated to ivory-bills as a whole, remains an open question.[45] Ivory-billed woodpeckers have been found in habitat including dense swampland, comparatively open old-growth forest, and the upland pine forests of Cuba, but whether that is a complete list of suitable habitat is somewhat unclear.[46]"}, {"0": "In the Tensas river region, Tanner estimate there was one pair of birds per 44\u00a0km2 (17\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). From historical data he estimated there was one pair of birds per 25\u00a0km2 (10\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the California swamp in northern Florida and one pair per 16\u00a0km2 (6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) along the Wacissa river, he produced an understanding that these birds need large amounts of suitable territory to find enough food to feed themselves and their young, and thus they should be expected occur at low densities even in healthy populations.[47] After the Civil War, the timber industry deforested millions of acres in the South, leaving only sparse, isolated tracts of appropriate habitat. Combined with the large range needs, this became the general understanding of the reason for the population decline of the species in the South. This picture has been disputed by Noel Snyder, who contended that hunting rather than habitat loss had been the primary cause of the population decline. He argued that Tanner's population estimates were made of an already depleted population, and the home range needs were significantly smaller.[48]"}, {"0": "The preferred food of the ivory-billed woodpecker is beetle larvae, with roughly half of recorded stomach contents composed of large beetle larvae, particularly of species from the family Cerambycidae,[49] with Scolytidae beetles also recorded.[50] The bird also eats significant vegetable matter, with recorded stomach contents including the fruit of the southern magnolia, pecans,[49] acorns,[50] hickory nuts, and poison ivy seeds.[51] They also have been observed feeding on wild grapes, persimmons, and hackberries.[52] To hunt woodboring grubs, the bird uses its enormous bill to hammer, wedge, and peel the bark off dead trees in order to access their tunnels.  The species has no real competitors in hunting these grubs. No other species present in its range are able to remove tightly bound bark, as the ivory-billed woodpecker does.[53]"}, {"0": "Ivory-billed woodpeckers are diurnal birds, spending their nights in individual roost holes that often are reused. The birds typically leave their roost holes around dawn, feeding and engaging in other activities during the early morning. They are generally inactive during the mid-day and resume feeding activities in the late afternoon before returning to the roosts around dusk.[54]"}, {"0": "The ivory-billed woodpecker is thought to mate for life. Pairs are known to travel together. These paired birds breed every year between January and May. Both parents work together to excavate a cavity in a tree approximately 15\u201370 feet (4.6\u201321.3\u00a0m)[55] from the ground for the nest in which their young will be raised. Limited data indicates a preference for living trees,[56] or partially dead trees, with rotten ones avoided.[55] Nest cavities are typically in or just below broken off stumps in living trees, where the wood is easier to excavate, and the overhanging stump can provide protection against rain and leave the opening in shadow, providing some protection against predators.[57] There are no clear records of nest cavities being reused, and ivory-bills, like most woodpeckers, likely excavate a new nest each year.[58] Nest openings are typically oval to rectangular in shape, and measure approximately 12\u201314\u00a0cm (4.7\u20135.5\u00a0in) tall by 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) wide. The typical nest depth is roughly 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in), with nests as shallow as 36\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) and as deep as 150\u00a0cm (59\u00a0in) reported.[59]"}, {"0": "Typically, eggs are laid in April or May, with a few records of eggs laid as early as mid-February.[60] A second clutch has only been observed when the first one failed.[61] Up to three glossy, china-white eggs are laid, measuring on average 3.5\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0cm (1.38\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.98\u00a0in),[50] although clutches of up to six eggs, and broods of up to four young, have been observed.[62] No nest has been observed for the length of incubation so it remains unknown,[63] although Tanner estimated it to be roughly 20 days.[64] Parents incubate the eggs cooperatively, with the male observed to incubate overnight, and the two birds typically exchanging places every two hours during the day, with one foraging and one incubating. Once the young hatch, both parents forage to bring food to them.[65] Young learn to fly about 7 to 8 weeks after hatching. The parents continue feeding them for another two months. The family eventually splits up in late fall or early winter."}, {"0": "Ivory-billed woodpeckers are not migratory, and pairs are frequently observed to nest within a few hundred meters of previous nests, year after year.[61] Although ivory-billed woodpeckers thus feed within a semiregular territory within a few kilometers of their nest or roost, they are not territorial; no records are known of ivory-bills protecting their territories from other ivory-bills when encountering one another.[66] Indeed, in many instances the ivory-billed woodpecker has been observed acting as a social bird, with groups of four or five feeding together on a single tree, and as many as 11 observed feeding in the same location.[67] Similarly, ivory-billed woodpeckers have been observed feeding on the same tree as the pileated woodpecker, the only other large woodpecker with which they share a range, without any hostile interactions.[68] Although not migratory, sometimes the ivory-billed woodpecker is described as nomadic;[69] birds relocate from time to time to areas where disasters such as fires or floods have created large amounts of dead wood, and subsequently large numbers of beetle larva upon which they prefer to feed.[28]"}, {"0": "The maximum lifespan of an Ivory-billed woodpecker is not known, but other Campephilus woodpeckers are not known to live longer than 15 years, so this value is sometimes used as an estimate.[70] No species (other than humans) are known to be predators of ivory-billed woodpeckers. However, they have been observed to exhibit predator response behaviors toward Cooper's hawks and red-shouldered hawks.[53]"}, {"0": "Heavy logging activity exacerbated by hunting by collectors devastated the population of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the late 19th century. The species was generally considered extremely rare and some ornithologists believed it extinct by the 1920s. In 1924, Arthur Augustus Allen found a nesting pair in Florida, which local taxidermists shot for specimens.[71] In 1932, a Louisiana state representative, Mason Spencer of Tallulah, killed an ivory-billed woodpecker along the Tensas River and took the specimen to his state wildlife office in Baton Rouge.[72] As a result, Arthur Allen, fellow Cornell Ornithology professor Peter Paul Kellogg, Ph.D. student James Tanner, and avian artist George Miksch Sutton organized an expedition to that part of Louisiana as part of a larger expedition to record images and sounds of endangered birds across the United States.[71] The team located a population of woodpeckers in Madison Parish in northeastern Louisiana, in a section of the old-growth forest called the Singer tract, owned by the Singer Sewing Company, where logging rights were held by the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company. The team made the only universally accepted audio and motion picture recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker.[73] The National Audubon Society attempted to buy the logging rights to the tract so the habitat and birds could be preserved, but the company rejected their offer. Tanner spent 1937\u20131939 studying the ivory-billed woodpeckers on the Singer tract and travelling across the southern United States searching for other populations as part of his thesis work. At that time, he estimated there were 22\u201324 birds remaining, of which 6\u20138 were on the Singer tract. The last universally accepted sighting of an ivory billed woodpecker in the United States was made on the Singer tract by Audubon Society artist Don Eckelberry in April 1944,[74] when logging of the tract was nearly complete.[75]"}, {"0": "The ivory-billed woodpecker was listed as an endangered species on March 11, 1967, by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Similarly, in many cases, reports of hearing the kent call of the ivory-billed woodpecker were misidentifications of a similar call sometimes made by blue jays.[35] It also may be possible to mistake wing collisions in flying duck flocks for the characteristic double knock.[78] However, a significant number of reports were accompanied by physical evidence or made by experienced ornithologists and could not be easily dismissed.[35]"}, {"0": "In 1950, the Audubon Society established a wildlife sanctuary along the Chipola River after a group led by University of Florida graduate student Whitney Eastman reported a pair of ivory-billed woodpeckers with a roost hole.[79][80] The sanctuary was terminated in 1952 when the woodpeckers could no longer be located.[81]"}, {"0": "In 1967, ornithologist John Dennis, sponsored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, reported sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers along the Neches River in Texas.[82] Previously, Dennis had rediscovered the Cuban species in 1948.[15] Dennis produced audio recording of possible kent calls that were found to be a good match to ivory-billed woodpecker calls, but possibly, also compatible with blue jays.[83] At least 20 people reported sightings of one or more ivory-billed woodpeckers in the same area in the late 1960s,[84] and several photographs, ostensibly showing an ivory-billed woodpecker in a roost, were produced by Neil Wright.[85][86] Copies of two of his photographs were given to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.[35] These sightings formed part of the basis for the creation of the Big Thicket National Preserve.[87][88]"}, {"0": "H.

In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais.[3] These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat.[4]"}, {"0": "The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler.[5][6]"}, {"0": "The garden warbler was given the binomial name Motacilla borin by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783.[7] The current genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland nymph, related to silva, a wood.[8] The specific borin is derived from a local name for the bird in the Genoa area of Italy; it derives from the Latin bos, ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.[9]"}, {"0": "There are two recognised subspecies.[10]"}, {"0": "Intermediate birds occur where the recognised forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, but these are not generally accepted as valid taxa.[10]"}, {"0": "The garden warbler is 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) long with a 7.6\u20138.4\u00a0cm (3.0\u20133.3\u00a0in) wing length.[10] The weight is typically 16\u201322\u00a0g (0.56\u20130.78\u00a0oz), but can be up to 35.5\u00a0g (1.25\u00a0oz) for birds preparing to migrate.[12] It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed bird with unstreaked olive-brown upperparts and dull white underparts.[13] It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale supercilium, and there is a buff wash to the throat and flanks. The eye is black, the legs are bluish-grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower mandible. The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size. Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult, with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts. The eastern subspecies S. b. woodwardi is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts.[10] The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa, but a wing length greater than 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) confirms S. b. woodwardi when birds are trapped.[13]"}, {"0": "The plain appearance of the garden warbler means that it can be confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The booted warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.[10]"}, {"0": "Juvenile garden warblers have a partial moult mainly involving the body plumage between June and September prior to migration.

The song is confusable with that of the blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate.[14] The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp kek-kek, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed.[15] A quiet rasping tchurr-r-r-r resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard.[10] The juvenile has a quia alarm vocalisation.[13] Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.[14]"}, {"0": "The garden warbler breeds in most of Europe between the 12\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u201382\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherms and east across temperate Asia to the Yenisei River in Siberia. Its range extends further north than any other Sylvia warbler. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa as far south as South Africa.[12] Birds from central Europe initially migrate to the southwest, reorientating to the south or southeast once in Africa, although Scandinavian migrants may head south through the Alps and across the Mediterranean Sea. S. b. woodwardi reaches Africa by a more easterly route, many birds passing through the Arabian Peninsula. When garden warblers cross the Sahara, they fly at night, resting motionless and without feeding in suitable shade during the day.[16] During their journey, they can metabolise not only body fat but also up to 19% of their breast and leg muscles and 39% of their digestive tract. Many birds pause for a few days to feed after the desert crossing before continuing further south.[17]"}, {"0": "The nominate subspecies occurs in the western and central parts of the winter range,[12] although some birds occur as far east as Kenya.[18] S. b. woodwardi winters in eastern and southern Africa.[10] Movements in Africa are poorly known, although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years.[17] There are only a handful of records of birds recorded in Europe in winter, from Corsica, the UK and Ireland. Spring migration routes are poorly known, but appear to lie more directly across the Mediterranean.[17] This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iceland, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Somalia, Yemen, Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Madeira.[12][19]"}, {"0": "The breeding habitat of the garden warbler is open areas with dense bushes, including thickets and woodland edges. Shady areas and a bushy or herbaceous undergrowth are preferred, as are woods adjacent to rivers or reed beds; in Ireland it favours thickets on the shores of small lakes. A tolerance of willow, alder and birch allows it to breed farther north and at higher altitudes than any other European Sylvia warbler. Mature conifers and dense plantations are avoided, although young conifer plantations with thick undergrowth are suitable for nesting. Despite its name, it is not a bird of gardens. In Africa, a wide range of habitats with trees are used, although closed forests and arid areas are again avoided. This warbler occurs at altitudes of up to 2,600\u00a0m (8,500\u00a0ft) in suitable mountain woodland, although in East Africa it is usually found at a lower altitude than the blackcap, and in moister areas than the common whitethroat.[17]"}, {"0": "Garden warblers first breed when they are one year old, and are mainly monogamous, although the male at least may sometimes deviate from this.[14] When males return to their breeding areas, they establish a territory.[14] Sylvia warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other species in their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same woods, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap.[20][21] Similar songs are a feature of the Sylvia warblers as a group, and it has been suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species.[22][23] However, it appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle differences in habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.[24] There are typically 3\u20139 territories per hectare (1.2\u20133.6 per acre), but in prime habitat, such as moist willow or birch woodland or young deciduous regrowth, there may be more than 10 pairs per hectare (4 per acre).[17] Individual territories are similar in size to those of blackcaps at 0.2\u20130.76\u00a0ha (0.49\u20131.88 acres).[25]"}, {"0": "A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display which involves rapid wing beating while perched. He will also build a number of simple nests (cock's nests) to show to his mate, although only rarely will she complete the structure, usually starting afresh.[14] The nest is concealed in vegetation, the nature of which depends on local availability. Rubus species are commonly used in temperate regions, with willow predominating in alpine valleys. Sometimes, particularly in stinging nettles, the nest may be built around a number of vertical stems, in the manner of a reed warbler. The nest is normally between 0.3 and 1.2\u00a0m (0.98 and 3.94\u00a0ft) above the ground, and very rarely higher than 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft).[17] The nest is a cup of dry grass, moss and twigs, with a soft lining of finer plant material or hair.[14] It is larger and heavier than a blackcap's nest, averaging 8.3\u00a0cm (3.3\u00a0in) high and 11.2\u00a0cm (4.4\u00a0in) wide with a cup 5.5\u00a0cm (2.2\u00a0in) deep and 6.3\u00a0cm (2.5\u00a0in) wide.[26]"}, {"0": "The first eggs are laid in late April in southern Germany, early May in northwest Europe, and late May in Finland. The season is prolonged with some birds nesting as late as July.[12] The clutch is typically four or five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish or buff with grey, purple and brown blotches.[12] The average size of the egg is 20\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a015\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a00.59\u00a0in), and it weighs 2.2\u00a0g (0.078\u00a0oz), of which 6% is shell.[27] The eggs are incubated for 11\u201312\u00a0days by both adults, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10\u00a0days after hatching (range 9\u201312), leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly.[12] They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks, and the family may stay together for a few days after that.[17] The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure, the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible, even while still flightless. This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood, but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves.[28] One brood per year is normal,[29] although a few second broods are known.[17]"}, {"0": "The southward migration starts in mid-July, with larger numbers departing in August and peaking in early September. Most adults have gone by mid-September, although juveniles may linger for another month.[12]"}, {"0": "On average, just over 50% of breeding pairs are successful in producing at least one fledged young from a nest, with early breeding and low population density being factors increasing success. In the UK, more than 50% of the failures are due to predation and about 30% result from food shortages in bad weather.[17] The annual survival rate is about 50% for adults and 26% for juveniles in their first year. The typical lifespan is two years,[27] but a bird in Sweden lived to ten\u00a0years and two\u00a0months.[30] Much greater ages, up to 24\u00a0years, have been recorded in captive garden warblers.[17]"}, {"0": "The garden warbler feeds mainly on insects in the breeding season, although other small invertebrates such as spiders are also eaten. It picks its prey off leaves and twigs, sometimes hovering to do so. It normally forages at less than 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) above the ground.[12] After nesting, there is a genetically controlled switch to a fruit diet, although insects are still consumed while the birds fatten prior to migration;[17] birds gain weight more rapidly from a diet containing both fruit and insects than either alone.[31] Berries and other soft fruit are preferred,[17] and figs are particularly important for birds preparing to migrate.[32] This predilection gives rise to the Italian beccafico (fig pecker) and Portuguese felosa-das-figueiras (fig-tree warbler) as names for this species.[14] On this diet a bird can gain weight quickly and the liver increases the rate at which it produces fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue.[31][33]"}, {"0": "In Africa, the warbler eats insects as well as berries, and the fruits of the introduced Spanish flag is a favourite where present.[14] An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey.[34] Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season.[35] Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.[34]"}, {"0": "Fruit is normally picked by a perched bird, although there is a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit-eating passerines.[36] Over 35 plant species have been recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe, with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds.[17]"}, {"0": "The main predators of the garden warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and domestic cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean.[37][38][39] Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels.[40][41] The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.[42] The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.[43]"}, {"0": "External parasites of the garden warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host.[44][45] Two species of protozoan parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat.[46] Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are found only in the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.[5]"}, {"0": "The garden warbler has a very large range of 9,650,000\u00a0km2 (3,730,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and its population in Europe is estimated at 17\u201331\u00a0million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54 and 124\u00a0million individuals.

Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.[47]"}, {"0": "In his History of Animals, Aristotle considered that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap.[48] The composer Olivier Messiaen used the song of the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species.[49] His Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement.

Audubon saw the species just once in Florida in 1832. It expanded its range substantially northwards in the 1940s and to the west in the 1980s.[5] This species is migratory; most European birds winter in Africa, and in North America[6] birds from north of the Carolinas winter farther south. Though generally suspected to be a migratory species in India, the glossy ibis is resident in western India.[7] Birds from other populations may disperse widely outside the breeding season. It is increasing in Europe.[1] It disappeared as a regular breeding bird in Spain in the early 20th century, but re-established itself in 1993 and has since rapidly increased with thousands of pairs in several colonies.[8] It has also established rapidly increasing breeding colonies in France, a country with very few breeding records before the 2000s.[9] An increasing number of non-breeding visitors are seen in northwestern Europe, a region where glossy ibis records historically were very rare.[10] For example, there appears to be a growing trend for birds to winter in Britain and Ireland, with at least 22 sightings in 2010.[11] In 2014, a pair attempted to breed in Lincolnshire, the first such attempt in Britain [12] A few birds now spend most summers in Ireland, but there is no present evidence of breeding.

Nesting is often in mixed-species colonies. When not nesting, flocks of over 100 individuals may occur on migration, and during the winter or dry seasons the species is usually found foraging in small flocks.

It uses spruce, larch, Scots pine, silver fir and mountain pine, and in man-made landscapes also introduced conifers such as douglas fir.[4] Breeding densities of up to 591 pairs per square km (1,530 pairs per square mile) have been recorded in Norway spruce in Ireland, and goldcrests constituted over 60% of all birds found in Welsh Douglas fir and Norway spruce plantations.[6] Broad-leaved woods are used only when some spruce or firs are also present. Sites such as parks and cemeteries are used only when they offer suitable conifers that are not otherwise locally available. The height and nature of any undergrowth is irrelevant.[4]"}, {"0": "Unlike more specialised birds such as the Eurasian nuthatch and the Eurasian treecreeper, both of which forage on tree trunks, the kinglets do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size.[28] Once breeding is over, this species will readily move into deciduous trees and shrubs, heathland and similar more open habitats.[4]"}, {"0": "The Tenerife subspecies occurs in the mountain region previously occupied by laurisilva, but now dominated by tree heaths.

The goldcrest has occurred as a vagrant in Jordan and Morocco.[4][7]"}, {"0": "This species is partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their breeding areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia south of the breeding range.[7] Birds in northern Fennoscandia and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights.[4] Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the Isle of May in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983.[6] Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.[4]"}, {"0": "A study in the Baltic region showed that northern goldcrests were more likely to migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat reserves. The travel speed of migrating goldcrests increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat reserves travelled at the highest speeds.[30] The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected in this tiny bird by poor health.[31] In Hungary, goldcrests stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in scrub, including blackthorn, hawthorn and pear, which provided some protection from sparrowhawks. Females migrated slightly earlier than males, but overall there were more males, with an average sex ratio of 1.6:1. Goldcrests can fly 250\u2013800\u00a0km (160\u2013500\u00a0mi) in one day, although they keep at a lower level in heavy headwinds.[32] This is a tame and inquisitive bird, and tired migrants will land near or on humans, sometimes searching for food on their clothing.[33]"}, {"0": "The North Atlantic oscillation is an atmospheric phenomenon affecting the weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s.[34] The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.[35]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest is monogamous. The male sings during the breeding season, usually while foraging rather than from a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest.[4] Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs.[36] However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either one or the other is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.[37]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest's nest is a well-insulated cup-shaped structure built in three layers.[38] The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the cobwebs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, which is lined by an inner layer of feathers and hair.[4] The nest is larger, shallower and less compact than that of the firecrest, with an internal diameter of about 9.0\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in),[39] and is constructed by both sexes, although the female does most of the work. It is often suspended from a hanging branch, usually at no great height, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from 1.0\u201322\u00a0m (3.3\u201372.2\u00a0ft).

The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her brood patch and also by putting her warm legs into the middle of the pile between the eggs.[38] Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20% larger than the first egg.[42] Second clutches, which are common, are laid usually while the first nest still has young. The male builds the second nest,[38] then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second; when the first brood has fledged, he joins the female in feeding the second brood.[4] The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating. She is a tight sitter, reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed, and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved, or even when it is being held.[43]"}, {"0": "The eggs are maintained at 36.5\u00a0\u00b0C (97.7\u00a0\u00b0F), the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting. She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature, and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day.[44] The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge in a further 17 to 22 days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young,[4] and in very hot weather, the female has been noted as taking drops of water to her chicks in her bill.[6] This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has an annual adult mortality of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months, which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few Coturnix species.[45] There are nonetheless records of an individual surviving to 4\u00a0years 10\u00a0months,[41] and even a report of a bird ringed in Winchester in the UK in 1989 and found dead in Morocco 7 years and 7 months later.[46]"}, {"0": "Although their ranges overlap substantially, hybridisation between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species.[47]"}, {"0": "All Regulus species are almost exclusively insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also feed on the cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).[47]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest takes a wide variety of prey, especially spiders, caterpillars, bugs, springtails and flies. Larger prey such as oak bush crickets and tortrix moths may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there is a record of a goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed.[6] Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with tits. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking sap from broken birch twigs together with tits and nuthatches.[6]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides of branches and leaves. This is in contrast to the common firecrest, which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of common firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative.[47] The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep furrows in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother surface.[48]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the common chiffchaff, and there is some evidence that high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5\u00a0million breeding pairs of goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4\u00a0million breeding pairs of chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other Phylloscopus warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the chiffchaff is found within 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) of the forest edge, with the goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland.[49] Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the chiffchaff subspecies Phylloscopus collybita abietinus in parts of Finland is due to competition with the willow warbler and goldcrest.[50]"}, {"0": "Outside the breeding season, small groups of goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers.[7] This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds.[51] A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but did not do so where the larger tits were retained.[52] In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap.[6]"}, {"0": "Several small passerine species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower metabolic rate and hypothermia, of a maximum of 10\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u00a0\u00b0F) below normal body temperature, in order to reduce energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn.[53] Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and that they actually use behavioural thermoregulation strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights.[53] Two birds roosting together reduce their heat loss by a quarter, and three birds by a third.[54] During an 18\u2011hour winter night, with temperatures as low as \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221213\u00a0\u00b0F) in the north of its range, goldcrests huddled together can each burn off fat equivalent to 20% of body weight to keep warm.[38]"}, {"0": "Migrating birds rely largely on stored fat and they also metabolise protein as a supplementary source of energy.[55] Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1\u20132 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore lower than that of the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.[32]"}, {"0": "Throughout the goldcrest's range, the main predator of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which has a diet consisting of up to 98% of birds.[56] Merlins, tawny and long-eared owls also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, may help to confuse their predators.[6] The goldcrest has only very rarely been recorded as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite.[57][58]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest is a host of the widespread moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae,[59] and of the louse Philopterus reguli.[60] The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan,[61] and at the other end of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain.[60][62] These lice move over the host's body,[63] and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material.[64] A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers.[65][66] The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.[67]"}, {"0": "The goldcrest has a large range, estimated at 13.2\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (5.1\u00a0million\u00a0mi2) and a total population estimated at 80\u2013200\u00a0million individuals, and it is therefore classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.[1][68] There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters.[4]"}, {"0": "Although dense conifer growth can provide shelter for roosting at night, losses in hard winters can be heavy. In a Finnish study, only one-tenth of the wintering goldcrest population, which mainly fed on spiders, survived to spring. Each group roamed within a defined winter territory, and their winter survival depended on the density of the food supply. For these northern birds there is a trade off between staying put and risking starvation, or facing the perils of migration.[6] Even in somewhat milder regions, where over-wintering is normal, exceptionally cold winters can cause such heavy losses that breeding populations take several years to recover. In 1930, the English ornithologist Thomas Coward wrote:[69]"}, {"0": "Until the severe winter of 1916\u201317 the Goldcrest was abundant and widespread, nesting in all the wooded portions of our islands; in 1920 it could have little more than an obituary notice, for the nesting stock was practically \"wiped out.\"\u00a0... and for some years, even as a winter visitor, the Goldcrest remained rare, absent from most of its nesting haunts. It is, however, now fully re-established."}, {"0": "Conversely, populations can expand rapidly after a series of mild winters.

Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird that had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title.[71][72] Following from this legend, in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \"king of the birds\" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the Regulus species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles,[73] and, because of the legend's reference to the \"smallest of birds\" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren.[33][74] The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 basileus, \"king\") and the crests (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 basiliskos, \"kinglet\").[75] In English, the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet's old name of \"gold-crested wren\".[76]"}, {"0": "It has had little other impact on literature,[33] although it is the subject of Charles Tennyson Turner's short poem, \"The Gold-crested Wren\", first published in 1868.[77] An old English name for the goldcrest is the \"woodcock pilot\", since migrating birds preceded the arrival of Eurasian woodcocks by a couple of days. There are unfounded legends that the goldcrest would hitch a ride in the feathers of the larger bird,[33] and similar stories claimed that owls provided the transport.[6] Suffolk fishermen called this bird \"herring spink\" or \"tot o'er seas\" because migrating goldcrests often landed on the rigging of herring boats out in the North Sea.[78]"}, {"0": "The golden babbler (Cyanoderma chrysaeum) is a babbler species in the family Timaliidae.

It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. They are one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and large, sharp talons to hunt a variety of prey, mainly hares, rabbits, and marmots and other ground squirrels.[4]\nGolden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200\u00a0km2 (77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years. Most breeding activities take place in the spring; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Females lay up to four eggs, and then incubate them for six weeks. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months. These juvenile golden eagles usually attain full independence in the fall, after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years."}, {"0": "Once widespread across the Holarctic, it has disappeared from many areas that are heavily populated by humans.

The type locality was given simply as \"Europa\"; it was later fixed to Sweden. It was moved to the new genus Aquila by French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.[7] Aquila is Latin for \"eagle\", possibly derived from aquilus, \"dark in colour\" and chrysaetos is Ancient Greek for the golden eagle from khrusos, \"gold\" and aetos, \"eagle\".[8]"}, {"0": "The golden eagle is part of a broad group of raptors called \"booted eagles\" which are defined by the feature that all species have feathering over their tarsus, unlike many other accipitrids which have bare legs. Included in this group are all species described as \"hawk eagles\" including the genera Spizaetus and Nisaetus, as well as assorted monotypical genera such as Oroaetus, Lophaetus, Stephanoaetus, Polemaetus, Lophotriorchis and Ictinaetus. The genus Aquila is distributed across every continent but for South America and Antarctica. Up to 20 species have been classified in the genus, but more recently the taxonomic placement of some of the traditional species has been questioned. Traditionally, the Aquila eagles have been grouped superficially as largish, mainly brownish or dark-colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages. Genetic research has recently indicated the golden eagle is included in a clade with Verreaux's eagle in Africa as well as the Gurney's eagle (A. gurneyi) and the wedge-tailed eagle (clearly part of an Australasian radiation of the lineage). This identification of this particular clade has long been suspected based on similar morphological characteristics amongst these large-bodied species.[5] More surprisingly, the smaller, much paler-bellied sister species Bonelli's eagle (A. fasciatus) and African hawk-eagle (A. spilogaster), previously included in the genus Hieraaetus, have been revealed to be genetically much closer to the Verreaux's and golden eagle lineage than to other species traditionally included in the genus Aquila.[4][9][10] Other largish Aquila species, the eastern imperial, the Spanish imperial, the tawny and the steppe eagles, are now thought to be separate, close-knit clade, which attained some similar characteristics to the prior clade via convergent evolution.[9][10] Genetically, the \"spotted eagles\" (A. pomarina, hastata and clanga), have been discovered to be more closely related to the long-crested eagle (Lophaetus occipitalis) and the black eagle (Ictinaetus malayensis), and many generic reassignments have been advocated.[9][11] The genus Hieraaetus, including the booted eagle (H. pennatus), little eagle (H. morphnoides) and Ayres's hawk-eagle (H. ayresii), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated Spilornis serpent-eagle genus. This genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and is now occasionally also included in Aquila, although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification.[4][10][12] The small-bodied Wahlberg's eagle (H. wahlbergi) has been traditionally considered a Aquila species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color but it is actually genetically aligned to the Hieraaetus lineage.[9][13] Cassin's hawk-eagle (H. africanus) is also probably closely related to the Hieraaetus group rather than the Spizaetus/Nisaetus \"hawk-eagle\" group (in which it was previously classified) which is not known to have radiated to Africa.[14]"}, {"0": "There are six extant subspecies of golden eagle that differ slightly in size and plumage. Individuals of any of the subspecies are somewhat variable and the differences between the subspecies are clinal, especially in terms of body size. Other than these characteristics, there is little variation across the range of the species.[15] Some recent studies have gone so far as to propose that only two subspecies be recognized based on genetic markers: Aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos (including A. c. homeyeri) and A. c. canadensis (including A. c. japonica, A. c. daphanea and A. c. kamtschatica).[16]"}, {"0": "The larger Middle Pleistocene golden eagles of France (and possibly elsewhere) are referred to a paleosubspecies Aquila chrysaetos bonifacti, and the huge specimens of the Late Pleistocene of Liko Cave (Crete) have been named Aquila chrysaetos simurgh (Weesie, 1988).[29][30][31] Similarly, an ancestral golden eagle, with a heavier, broader skull, larger wings and shorter legs when compared to modern birds, has been found in the La Brea Tar Pits of southern California.[32]"}, {"0": "The golden eagle is a very large raptor, 66 to 102 centimetres (26 to 40\u00a0in) in length.

Females of the large Himalayan golden eagles are about 37% heavier than males and have nearly 9% longer wings, whereas in the smaller Japanese golden eagles, females are only 26% heavier with around 6% longer wings.[4][36] In the largest subspecies (A. c. daphanea), males and females weigh typically 4.05 and 6.35\u00a0kg (8.9 and 14.0\u00a0lb), respectively. In the smallest subspecies, A. c. japonica, males weigh 2.5\u00a0kg (5.5\u00a0lb) and females 3.25\u00a0kg (7.2\u00a0lb).[4] In the species overall, males average around 3.6\u00a0kg (7.9\u00a0lb) and females around 5.1\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb).[37] The maximum size of golden eagles is debated. Large subspecies are the heaviest representatives of the genus Aquila and this species is on average the seventh-heaviest living eagle species. The golden eagle is the second heaviest breeding eagle in North America, Europe and Africa and the fourth heaviest in Asia.[5][15] For some time, the largest known mass authenticated for a wild female was the specimen from the A. c. chrysaetos subspecies which weighed around 6.7\u00a0kg (15\u00a0lb) and spanned 2.55\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in) across the wings.[21] American golden eagles are typically somewhat smaller than the large Eurasian species, but a massive female that was banded and released in 2006 around Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest became the heaviest wild golden eagle on record, at 7.7\u00a0kg (17\u00a0lb).[38]  Captive birds have been measured with a wingspan of 2.81\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) and a mass of 12.1\u00a0kg (27\u00a0lb), though this mass was for an eagle bred for falconry, which tend to be unnaturally heavy.[21]"}, {"0": "The standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of 52\u201372\u00a0cm (20\u201328\u00a0in), a tail length of 26.5\u201338\u00a0cm (10.4\u201315.0\u00a0in) and a tarsus length of 9.4\u201312.2\u00a0cm (3.7\u20134.8\u00a0in).[15] The culmen (upper ridge of beak) reportedly averages around 4.5\u00a0cm (1.8\u00a0in), with a range of 3.6 to 5\u00a0cm (1.4 to 2.0\u00a0in).

They have a less faded colour. Young birds are white for about two-thirds of their tail length, ending with a broad, black band.[36] Occasionally, juvenile eagles have white patches on the remiges at the bases of the inner primaries and the outer secondaries, forming a crescent marking on the wings which tends to be divided by darker feathers.[4][46] Rarely, juvenile birds may have only traces of white on the tail. Compared to the relatively consistently white tail, the white patches on the wing are extremely variable; some juveniles have almost no white visible. Juveniles of less than 12 months of age tend to have the most white in their plumage.[44] By their second summer, the white underwing coverts are usually replaced by a characteristic rusty brown colour. By the third summer, the upper-wing coverts are largely replaced by dark brown feathers, although not all feathers moult at once which leaves many juvenile birds with a grizzled pattern. The tail follows a similar pattern of maturation to the wings.[44][46] Due to the variability between individuals, juvenile eagles cannot be reliably aged by sight alone.[47] Many golden eagles still have white on the tail during their first attempt at nesting.[48] The final adult plumage is not fully attained until the birds are between 5 and a half and 6 and a half years old.[47]"}, {"0": "This species moults gradually beginning in March or April until September or October each year. Moulting usually decreases in winter. Moult of the contour feathers begins on the head and neck region and progresses along the feather tracts in a general front-to-back direction. Feathers on head, neck, back and scapulars may be replaced annually. With large feathers of the wing and tail, moult begins with the innermost feathers and proceeds outwards in a straightforward manner known as \"descendant\" moult.[44]"}, {"0": "While many accipitrids are not known for their strong voices, golden eagles have a particular tendency for silence, even while breeding.[17] That being said, some vocalization has been recorded, usually centering around the nesting period. The voice of the golden eagle is considered weak, high, and shrill, has been called \"quite pathetic\" and \"puppy-like\", and seems incongruous with the formidable size and nature of the species.[15] Most known vocalisations seem to function as contact calls between eagles, sometimes adults to their offspring, occasionally territorial birds to intruders and rarely between a breeding pair. In western Montana, nine distinct calls were noted: a chirp, a seeir, a pssa, a skonk, a cluck, a wonk, a honk and a hiss.[49]"}, {"0": "Golden eagles are sometimes considered the best fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds.[17] They are equipped with broad, long wings with somewhat finger-like indentations on the tips of the wing.[15] Golden eagles are unique among their genus in that they often fly in a slight dihedral, which means the wings are often held in a slight, upturned V-shape.[15] When they need to flap, golden eagles appear at their most laboured, but this is less common than soaring or gliding\u2013\u2013.[4] Flapping flight usually consists of 6\u20138 deep wing-beats, interspersed with 2\u20133 second glides.[4] While soaring, the wings and tail are held in one plane with the primary tips often spread.[50] A typical, unhurried soaring speed in golden eagles is around 45\u201352 kilometres per hour (28\u201332\u00a0mph).[51] When hunting or displaying, the golden eagle can glide very fast, reaching speeds of up to 190 kilometres per hour (120\u00a0mph).[4][50] When stooping (diving) in the direction of prey or during territorial displays, the eagle holds its legs up against its tail, and holds its wings tight and partially closed against its body. When diving after prey, a golden eagle can reach 240 to 320 kilometres per hour (150 to 200\u00a0mph). Although less agile and manoeuvrable, the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon's stooping and gliding speeds.[5][52] This makes the golden eagle one of the two fastest living animals.[21] Although most flight in golden eagles has a clear purpose (e.g., territoriality, hunting), some flights, such as those by solitary birds or between well-established breeding pairs, seem to be play.[5][17][53]"}, {"0": "Size readily distinguishes this species from most other raptors when it is seen well. Most other raptors are considerably smaller. Buteo hawks, which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the \"booted eagle\" group, are often counted among the larger very common raptors. However, a mid-sized Buteo is dwarfed by a golden eagle, as an adult female eagle has about double the wingspan and about five times the weight. Buteos are also usually distinctly paler below, although some species occur in dark morphs which can be darker than a golden eagle.[15][54] Among raptorial birds that share the golden eagle's range, only some Old World vultures and the California condor are distinctly larger, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight; they often have dramatically different colour patterns. In North America, the golden eagle may be confused with the turkey vulture from a great distance, as it is a large species that, like the golden eagle, often flies with a pronounced dihedral. The turkey vulture can be distinguished by its less controlled, forceful flying style (they frequently rock back and forth unsteadily in even moderate winds) and its smaller, thinner body, much smaller head and, at closer range, its slaty black-brown colour and silvery wing secondaries.[55] Compared to Haliaeetus eagles, the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk-like and lack the flat, plank-like wing positioning seen in the other genus.[55] Large northern Haliaeetus species usually have a larger bill and larger head which protrudes more distinctly than a golden eagle's in flight. The tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of Haliaeetus eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight, whereas in the other eagles the head is often more than twice the length of the tail.[55] Confusion is most likely between juvenile Haliaeetus and golden eagles, as the adult golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration and all Haliaeetus eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults. Haliaeetus eagles are often heavily streaked in their juvenile phase. Juvenile golden eagles can have large patches of white on their wings and tail that are quite different from the random, sometimes large and splotchy-looking distribution of white typical of juvenile Haliaeetus.[15][55]"}, {"0": "Distinguishing the golden eagle from other Aquila eagles in Eurasia is more difficult. Identification may rely on the golden eagle's relatively long tail and patterns of white or grey on the wings and tail. Unlike golden eagles, other Aquila eagles do not generally fly in a pronounced dihedral. At close range, the golden to rufous nape-shawl of the golden eagle is distinctive from other Aquila. Most other Aquila eagles have darker plumage, although the smaller tawny eagle is often paler than the golden eagle (the overlap in range is verified only in Bale Mountains, Ethiopia). Among Eurasian Aquila, the adult eastern imperial and Spanish imperial eagle come closest to reaching the size of golden eagles, but both are distinguished by their longer necks, flatter wings in flight, white markings on their shoulder forewing-coverts, paler cream-straw coloured nape patch and generally darker colouration. Juvenile imperial eagles are much paler overall (caramel-cream in the Spanish; cream and tawny streaks in the eastern) and are not likely to be confused.[15] Steppe eagles can also approach golden eagles in size but are more compact and smaller headed with little colour variation to their dark earth-brown plumage, apart from juvenile birds which have distinctive cream-coloured bands running through their coverts and secondaries.[5] Verreaux's eagles are most similar in size and body shape to the golden, the body of the Verreaux's eagle being slightly longer overall but marginally less heavy and long-winged than the golden eagle's.[15] The plumage is very distinctly different, however, as Verreaux's eagles are almost entirely jet-black except for some striking, contrasting white on the wing primaries, shoulders and upper-wing.[15] This closely related species is known to co-occur with the golden eagle only in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia.[4] Other booted eagles in the golden eagle's range are unlikely to be confused due to differences in size and form. The only species in the genus Aquila that exceeds the golden eagle in average wingspan and length is the wedge-tailed eagle of Australasia; however, the wedge-tailed eagle is a slightly less heavy bird.[21]"}, {"0": "Golden eagles are fairly adaptable in habitat but often reside in areas with a few shared ecological characteristics. They are best suited to hunting in open or semi-open areas and search them out year-around. Native vegetation seems to be attractive to them and they typically avoid developed areas of any type from urban to agricultural as well as heavily forested regions. In desolate areas (e.g., the southern Yukon), they can occur regularly at roadkills and garbage dumps.[56] The largest numbers of golden eagles are found in mountainous regions today, with many eagles doing a majority of their hunting and nesting on rock formations. However, they are not solely tied to high elevations and can breed in lowlands if the local habitats are suitable. Below are more detailed descriptions of habitats occupied by golden eagles in both continents where they occur.[4]"}, {"0": "In the Arctic fringe of Eurasia, golden eagles occur along the edge of the tundra and the taiga from the Kola peninsula to Anadyr in eastern Siberia, nesting in forests and hunting over nearby arctic heathland. Typical vegetation is stunted, fragmented larch woodland merging into low birch-willow scrub and various heathland. In the rocky, wet, windy maritime climate of Scotland, Ireland, and western Scandinavia, the golden eagle dwells in mountains. These areas include upland grasslands, blanket bog, and sub-Arctic heaths but also fragmented woodland and woodland edge, including boreal forests. In Western Europe, golden eagle habitat is dominated by open, rough grassland, heath and bogs, and rocky ridges, spurs, crags, scree, slopes and grand plateaux. In Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, Belarus and almost the entire distribution in Russia all the way to the Pacific Ocean, golden eagles occur sparsely in lowland taiga forest. These areas are dominated by stands of evergreens such as pine, larch and spruce, occasionally supplemented by birch and alder stands in southern Scandinavia and the Baltic States. This is largely marginal country for golden eagles and they occur where tree cover is thin and abuts open habitat. Golden eagle taiga habitat usually consists of extensive peatland formations caused by poorly drained soils. In central Europe, golden eagles today occur almost exclusively in the major mountain ranges, such as the Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, and the Caucasus. Here, the species nests near the tree line and hunt subalpine and alpine pastures, grassland and heath above. Golden eagles also occur in moderately mountainous habitat along the Mediterranean Sea, from the Iberian Peninsula and the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, to Greece, Turkey and Iraq. This area is characterized by low mountains, Mediterranean maquis vegetation, and sub-temperate open woodland. The local pine-oak vegetation, with a variety of Sclerophyllous shrubs are well-adapted to prolonged summer droughts. From Turkey and the southern Caspian Sea to the foothills of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan, the typical golden eagle habitat is temperate desert-like mountain ranges surrounded by steppe landscapes interspersed with forest. Here the climate is colder and more continental than around the Mediterranean. Golden eagles occupy the alpine ranges from the Altai Mountains and the Pamir Mountains to Tibet, in the great Himalayan massif, and Xinjiang, China, where they occupy the Tien Shan range.[citation needed] In these mountain ranges, the species often lives at very high elevations, living above tree line at more than 2,500\u00a0m (8,200\u00a0ft), often nesting in rocky scree and hunting in adjacent meadows. In Tibet, golden eagles inhabit high ridges and passes in the Lhasa River watershed, where they regularly join groups of soaring Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis).[57] One golden eagle was recorded circling at 6,190\u00a0m (20,310\u00a0ft) above sea-level in Khumbu in May 1975.[58] In the mountains of Japan and Korea, the golden eagle occupies deciduous scrub woodland and carpet-like stands of Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) that merge into grasslands and alpine heathland. The golden eagle occurs in mountains from the Adrar Plateau in Mauritania to northern Yemen and Oman where the desert habitat is largely bereft of vegetation but offers many rocky plateaus to support both the eagles and their prey. In Israel, their habitat is mainly rocky slopes and wide wadi areas, chiefly in desert and to a lesser extent in semi-desert and Mediterranean climates, extending to open areas.[59] In Northeastern Africa, the habitat is often of a sparse, desert-like character and is quite similar to the habitat in Middle East and the Arabian peninsula. In Ethiopia's Bale Mountains, where the vegetation is more lush and the climate is clearly less arid than in Northeastern Africa, the golden eagle occupies verdant mountains.[4]"}, {"0": "The biomes occupied by golden eagles are roughly concurrent with those of Eurasia. In western and northern Alaska and northern Canada to the Ungava Peninsula in Quebec, the eagles occupy the Arctic fringe of North America (the species does not range into the true high Arctic tundra), where open canopy gives way to dwarf-shrub heathland with cottongrass and tussock tundra. In land-locked areas of the sub-Arctic, golden eagles are by far the largest raptor. From the Alaska Range to Washington and Oregon, it is often found in high mountains above the tree line or on bluffs and cliffs along river valleys below the tree line.[60][61] In Washington state, golden eagles can be found in clear-cut sections of otherwise dense coniferous forest zones with relatively little annual precipitation.[62] From east of the Canadian Rocky Mountains to the mountains of Labrador, the golden eagle is found in small numbers in boreal forest peatlands and similar mixed woodland areas. In the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in the United States are plains and prairies where golden eagles are widespread, especially where there is a low human presence. Here, grassland on low rolling hills and flat plains are typical, interrupted only by cottonwood stands around river valleys and wetlands where the eagles may build their nests. Golden eagles also occupy the desert-like Great Basin from southern Idaho to northern Arizona and New Mexico. In this habitat, trees are generally absent other than junipers with vegetation being dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia) and other low shrub species. Although the vegetation varies a bit more, similar habitat is occupied by golden eagles in Mexico.[63][64][65] However, golden eagles are typically absent in North America from true deserts, like the Sonora Desert, where annual precipitation is less than 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in).[66] Golden eagles occupy the mountains and coastal areas of California and Baja California in Mexico where hot, dry summers and moist winters are typical. The golden eagles here often nest in chaparral and oak woodland, oak savanna and grassland amongst low rolling hill typified by diverse vegetation.[67] In the Eastern United States, the species once bred widely in the Appalachian Plateau near burns, open marshes, meadows, bogs and lakes.[68][69] In Eastern North America, the species still breeds on the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec. Until 1999, a pair of golden eagles were still known to nest in Maine but they are now believed to be absent as a breeding bird from the Eastern United States.[4] The golden eagles who breed in eastern Canada winter on montane grass and heath fields in the Appalachian Plateau region, especially in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia. Most sightings in the Eastern United States recently are concentrated within or along southwestern border of the Appalachian Plateau (30% of records) and within the Coastal Plain physiographic region (33% of records).[70]"}, {"0": "Though they do regularly nest in the marsh-like peatland of the boreal forest, golden eagles are not generally associated with wetlands and, in fact, they can be found near some of the most arid spots on earth. In the wintering population of Eastern United States, however, they are often associated with steep river valleys, reservoirs, and marshes in inland areas as well as estuarine marshlands, barrier islands, managed wetlands, sounds, and mouths of major river systems in coastal areas. These wetlands are attractive due to a dominance of open vegetation, large concentrations of prey, and the general absence of human disturbance.[70] In the midwestern United States, they are not uncommon during winter near reservoirs and wildlife refuges that provide foraging opportunities at waterfowl concentrations.[71]"}, {"0": "Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho.[72] The hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in Idaho, showing that, out of 115 hunting attempts, 20% were successful in procuring prey.[73] A fully-grown golden eagle requires about 230 to 250\u00a0g (8.1 to 8.8\u00a0oz) of food per day but in the life of most eagles there are cycles of feast and famine, and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week and then gorge on up to 900\u00a0g (2.0\u00a0lb) at one sitting.[5]"}, {"0": "The diet of golden eagles is composed primarily of small mammals such as rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and marmots. They also eat other birds (usually of medium size, such as gamebirds),[74] reptiles, and fish in smaller numbers. Golden eagles occasionally capture large prey, including seals, ungulates, coyotes, and badgers. They have also been known to capture large flying birds such as geese or cranes.[75] They have also been known to prey on other raptors, including owls and falcons.[76]"}, {"0": "Despite the dramatic ways in which they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day.[77] During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting.[17] When conditions are heavily anticyclonic, there is less soaring during the day.[4] During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion.[4] In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion.[78] Golden eagles are believed to sleep through much of the night. Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter's night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.[79]"}, {"0": "Most populations of golden eagles are sedentary, but the species is actually a partial migrant. Golden eagles are very hardy species, being well adapted to cold climates, however they cannot abide declining available food sources in the northern stretches of their range. Eagles raised at latitudes greater than 60\u00b0 N are usually migratory, though a short migration may be untaken by those who breed or hatch at about 50\u00b0 N.[80] During migration, they often use soaring-gliding flight, rather than powered flight.[80] In Finland, most banded juveniles move between 1,000 and 2,000\u00a0km (620 and 1,240\u00a0mi) due south, whereas adults stay locally through winter. Further east, conditions are too harsh for even wintering territorial adults.[4] Golden eagles that breed from the Kola peninsula to Anadyr in the Russian Far East migrate south to winter on the Russian and Mongolian steppes, and the North China Plains. The flat, relatively open landscapes in these regions hold relatively few resident breeding golden eagles.[81] Similarly the entire population of golden eagles from northern and central Alaska and northern Canada migrates south. At Mount Lorette in Alberta, approximately 4,000 golden eagles may pass during the fall, the largest recorded migration of golden eagles on earth.[82] Here the mountain ranges are relatively moderate and consistent, thus being reliable for thermals and updrafts which made long-distance migrating feasible.[82] Birds hatched in Denali National Park in Alaska traveled from 818 to 4,815\u00a0km (508 to 2,992\u00a0mi) to their winter ranges in western North America.[80] These western migrants may winter anywhere from southern Alberta and Montana to New Mexico and Arizona and from inland California to Nebraska. Adults who bred in northeastern Hudson Bay area of Canada reached their wintering grounds, which range from central Michigan to southern Pennsylvania to northeastern Alabama, in 26 to 40 days, with arrival dates from November to early December.[83] The departure dates from wintering grounds are variable. In southwestern Canada, they leave their wintering grounds by 6 April to 8 May (the mean being 21 April); in southwestern Idaho, wintering birds leave from 20 March to 13 April (mean of 29 March); and in the Southwestern United States, wintering birds may depart by early March.[4][80][84] Elsewhere in the species' breeding range, golden eagles (i.e., those who breed in the contiguous Western United States, all of Europe but for Northern Scandinavia, North Africa and all of Asia but for Northern Russia) are non-migratory and tend to remain within striking distance of their breeding territories throughout the year.[15] In Scotland, among all recovered, banded golden eagles (36 out of 1000, the rest mostly died or disappeared) the average distance between ringing and recovery was 44\u00a0km (27\u00a0mi), averaging 63\u00a0km (39\u00a0mi) in juveniles and 36\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) in older birds.[4] In the dry Southwestern United States, golden eagles tend to move to higher elevations once the breeding season is complete.[53] In North Africa, populations breeding at lower latitudes, like Morocco, are mostly sedentary, although some occasionally disperse after breeding to areas outside of the normal breeding range.[85]"}, {"0": "Territoriality is believed to be the primary cause of interactions and confrontations between non-paired golden eagles. Golden eagles maintain some of the largest known home ranges (or territories) of any bird species but there is much variation of home range size across the range, possibly dictated by food abundance and habitat preference. Home ranges in most of the range can vary from 20 to 200\u00a0km2 (7.7 to 77.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[86] In San Diego County in California, the home ranges varied from 49 to 137\u00a0km2 (19 to 53\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), with an average of 93\u00a0km2 (36\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[87] However, some home ranges have been much smaller, such as in southwestern Idaho where, possibly due to an abundance of jackrabbits, home ranges as small as 4.85\u00a0km2 (1.87\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) are maintained.[64] The smallest known home ranges on record for golden eagles are in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, where they range from 1.5 to 9\u00a0km2 (0.58 to 3.47\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[88] 46% of undulating displays in Montana occurred shortly after the juvenile eagles left their parents range, suggesting that some residents defend and maintain territories year-round.[89] Elsewhere it is stated that home ranges are less strictly maintained during winter but hunting grounds are basically exclusive.[4] In Israel and Scotland, aggressive encounters peaked from winter until just before egg-laying and were less common during the nesting season.[4][90] Threat displays include undulating flight and aggressive direct flapping flight with exaggerated downstrokes.[49] Most displays by mature golden eagles (67% for males and 76% for females) occur, rather than around the nest, at the edge of their home ranges.[77] In Western Norway, most recorded undulating flight displays occur during the pre-laying period in late winter/early spring.[78] Display flights seem to be triggered by the presence of other golden eagles.[4] The use of display flights has a clear benefit in that it lessens the need for physical confrontations, which can be fatal.[77] Usually, non-breeding birds are treated aggressively by the golden eagle maintaining their home range, normally being chased to the apparent limit of the range but with no actual physical contact.[4] The territorial flight of the adult golden eagle is sometimes preceded or followed by intense bouts of undulating displays. The invader often responds by rolling over and presenting talons to the aggressor. Rarely, the two eagles will lock talons and tumble through the air; sometimes fall several revolutions and in some cases even tumble to the ground before releasing their grip.[78][91] In some parts of the Alps, the golden eagle population has reached the saturation point in appropriate habitat and apparently violent confrontations are more common than in other parts of the range.[92] Golden eagles may express their aggression via body language while perched, typically the adult female when confronted by an intruding eagle: the head and body are upright, feathers on head and neck are erect; the wings may be slightly spread and beak open; often accompanied by intense gaze. They then often engage in a similar posture with wings spread wide and oriented toward the threat; sometimes rocking back on tail and even flopping over onto the back with talons extended upward as defense. Such behavior may be accompanied by wing slap against the threatening intruder.[49] When approached by an intruder, the defending eagle turns away, partially spreads tail, lowers head, and remains still; adults on the nest may lower head and \"freeze\" when approached by a person or a helicopter.[49] Females in Israel displayed more than males and mostly against interspecific intruders; males apparently displayed primarily as part of courtship.[90] Five of 7 aggressive encounters at carcasses during winter in Norway were won by females; in 15 of 21 conflicts, the younger bird dominated an older conspecific.[93] However, obvious juvenile eagles (apparent to the adult eagles due to the amount of white on their wings and tail) are sometimes allowed to penetrate deeply into a pair's home range and all parties commonly ignore each other.[94][95] In North Dakota, it was verified that parent eagles were not aggressive towards their own young after the nesting period and some juveniles stayed on their parents territory until their 2nd spring and then left by their own accord.[96]"}, {"0": "Golden eagles usually mate for life. A breeding pair is formed in a courtship display. This courtship includes undulating displays by both in the pair, with the male bird picking up a piece of rock or a small stick, and dropping it only to enter into a steep dive and catch it in mid-air, repeating the maneuver 3 or more times. The female takes a clump of earth and drops and catches it in the same fashion.[4][27] Golden eagles typically build several eyries within their territory (preferring cliffs) and use them alternately for several years. Their nesting areas are characterized by the extreme regularity of the nest spacing.[97] Mating and egg-laying timing for golden eagle is variable depending on the locality. Copulation normally lasts 10\u201320 seconds. Mating seems to occur around 40\u201346 days before the initial egg-laying.[4] The golden eagle chick may be heard from within the egg 15 hours before it begins hatching. After the first chip is broken off of the egg, there is no activity for around 27 hours. Hatching activity accelerates and the shell is broken apart in 35 hours. The chick is completely free in 37 hours.[49]"}, {"0": "In the first 10 days, chicks mainly lie down on the nest substrate.[49]   They are capable of preening on their second day but their parents keep them warm until around 20 days.[4]  They grow considerably, weighing around 500\u00a0g (1.1\u00a0lb).[98]  They also start sitting up more.[49]  Around 20 days of age, the chicks generally start standing, which becomes the main position over the course of the next 40 days.[49] The whitish down continues until around 25 days of age, at which point it is gradually replaced by dark contour feathers that eclipse the down and the birds attain a general piebald appearance.[4] After hatching, 80% of food items and 90% of food biomass is captured and brought to the nest by the adult male. Fledging occurs at 66 to 75 days of age in Idaho and 70 to 81 days in Scotland. The first attempted flight departure after fledging can be abrupt, with the young jumping off and using a series of short, stiff wing-beats to glide downward or being blown out of nest while wing-flapping. 18 to 20 days after first fledging, the young eagles will take their first circling flight, but they cannot gain height as efficiently as their parents until approximately 60 days after fledging. In Cumbria, young golden eagles were first seen hunting large prey 59 days after fledging. 75 to 85 days after fledging, the young were largely independent of parents. Generally, breeding success seems to be greatest where prey is available in abundance.[4]"}, {"0": "Golden eagles are fairly long-living birds in natural conditions if they survive their first few years. The survival rate of raptorial birds tends to increase with larger body size, with a 30\u201350% annual loss of population rate in small falcons/accipiters, a 15\u201325% loss of population rate in medium-sized hawks (e.g., Buteos or kites) and a 5% or less rate of loss in eagles and vultures. The oldest known wild golden eagle was a bird banded in Sweden which was recovered 32 years later.[4] The longest-lived known wild golden eagle in North America was 31 years and 8 months.[99] The longest-lived known captive golden eagle, a specimen in Europe, survived to 46 years of age.[100] The estimated adult annual survival rate on the Isle of Skye in Scotland is around 97.5%.[101] When this extrapolated into an estimated lifespan this results in 39 and half years as the average for adult golden eagles in this area, which is probably far too high an estimate.[4] Survival rates are usually much lower in juvenile eagles than in adult eagles. In the western Rocky Mountains, 50% of golden eagles banded in the nest died by the time they were 2 and a half years and an estimated 75% died by the time they were 5 years old.[102] Near a wind turbine facility in west-central California, estimated survival rates, based on conventional telemetry of 257 individuals, were 84% for first-year eagles, 79% for 1- to 3-year-olds and adult floaters and 91% for breeders; with no difference in survival rates between sexes.[67] Survival rates may be lower for migrating populations of golden eagles.[103] A 19\u201334% survival rate was estimated for juvenile eagles from Denali National Park in their first 11 months.[103] The average life expectancy of golden eagles in Germany is 13 years, extrapolated from a reported mere 92.5% survival rate.[104]"}, {"0": "Natural sources of mortality are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles have been killed by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings are more likely to be killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt.[4] However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests.[4] Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt.[105] On the Isle of R\u00f9m in Scotland, there are a few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a doe having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn.[106]  Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight.[107]  There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being \"oiled\" by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly.[108]  Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation.[103]  Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes.[109]  Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not be directly attributed to human activities.[110]  Avian cholera caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of four fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho.[111] Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan.[112] A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors \u2013 one in the liver and one in the kidney.[113]"}, {"0": "In December 2016, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed allowing wind-turbine electric generation companies to kill golden eagles without penalty, so long as \"companies take steps to minimize the losses\". If issued, the permits would last 30 years, six times the current 5-year permits.[114][115]"}, {"0": "Human beings have been fascinated by the golden eagle as early as the beginning of recorded history. Most early-recorded cultures regarded the golden eagle with reverence. In pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, the eagle was a major Mexica (Aztec) symbol: the tribal and sun god, Huitzilopochtli, had told his people that when they saw the sun (i.e., Huitzilopochtli) in the form of an eagle perched on a cactus whose fruit was red and shaped like a human heart, there they should build their city, Tenochtitlan.

This is not a reference to any aspect of the golden white-eye's behaviour, but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands, les \u00celes des Voleurs, or Robbers' Islands.[7] The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens.[8]"}, {"0": "The golden white-eye is endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands in the western Pacific Ocean, where it currently occurs on the islands of Saipan and Aguijan. Within its range, it occupies a variety of habitats, both natural and man-made. It is common in native forests, particularly limestone forests, but also occurs in open shrubland and suburban areas. On Saipan, the only habitats it is absent from are the marshes around Lake Susupe and grassy savannas.[2]"}, {"0": "The golden white-eye differs from the other white-eyes in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (as it is in the other species). It is a large white-eye, 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) long and weighing around 20\u00a0g (0.7\u00a0oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.[2]"}, {"0": "The golden white-eye makes a variety of calls. The song is a long raspy warble, rendered as \"s\u00e9\u00e9 m\u00e9-can you s\u00e9\u00e9 m\u00e9-I can s\u00e9\u00e9 y\u00f3\u00fa-can you s\u00e9\u00e9 m\u00e9\". The species also makes rasping shorter calls and whistles when in flocks and in flight. Chicks give plaintive whistles when begging for food from adults.[2]"}, {"0": "Like other white-eyes, the golden white-eye is diurnal. In contrast to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young.[9] The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of them in order to disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.[10]"}, {"0": "The golden white-eye is a generalist, feeding on fruit, berries, and insects.[9] Nectar forms part of the diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a pollinator of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species.[11] Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range and that of the bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique.[12] At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves.[9] It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.[12]"}, {"0": "Breeding occurs throughout the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied.[13] The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July.[4] The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9\u00a0m (between 1.5 and 6.5\u00a0m) off the ground in a variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus.[13] The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers,[14] as well as the introduced green tree skink.[4]"}, {"0": "The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 \u00d7 15.1\u00a0mm in size, which are pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are concentrated around the wider end.[13] Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent incubating for stints of around 25\u00a0minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including bridled white-eyes, rufous fantails, and other golden white-eyes.[4] From laying it takes about two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 10\u201314 days after hatching.[13] After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time.[9]"}, {"0": "The range of the golden white-eye has contracted considerably since the arrival of humans in the Mariana Islands. Fossil bones of this species have been found on the nearby islands of Tinian and Rota, and it may once have occurred on Guam and other islands in the Marianas.[15]"}, {"0": "At present the golden white-eye is very common, and in fact a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest recorded for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km\u00b2 (8.47 per acre).[10] It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does.[16] A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.[17]"}, {"0": "The species is nonetheless evaluated as Endangered by the IUCN because the population is expected to undergo a rapid decline if the brown tree snake becomes established on Saipan.[1] The primary threat to this species is the brown tree snake,[1] a native of Australia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, which eliminated all 12 landbird species on nearby Guam after being accidentally introduced.[18] The snake has not yet become established on Saipan, one of the two islands that compose the range of the golden white-eye, and which holds the largest population of the species.[1] The isolation of Aguijan makes the introduction of brown tree snakes there unlikely, but the small population there is vulnerable as the island is only 718 ha (1774 acres) in size and a direct hit by a supertyphoon could wipe them out.[19] Efforts are under way to breed the species in captivity[20] and to prevent the snakes from being introduced and established on Saipan.[21] Six zoos have recently received this species and breeding was expected to begin by 2011.[4] Success came more quickly, and the first captive birds were bred in 2009 in the North Carolina Zoo.[22] Birds from captive breeding will be introduced on new islands.[4] In addition, 24 birds were translocated from Saipan to the island of Sarigan, a predator-free island reserve, in 2011 in the hope of establishing a breeding population.[1]"}, {"0": "The golden-backed bishop (Euplectes aureus) is a species of bird in the family Ploceidae.\nIt is found in western Angola and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island."}, {"0": "This Ploceidae-related article is a stub.

Individual birds remain with the same flock for the entire winter and return to the same wintering site each year.[15] Studies show that the golden-crowned sparrow's black and gold head stripes are used to signal social status in wintering flocks. Such signals help to reduce the incidence of confrontation between flock mates, thereby reducing such potential costs as injuries or the unnecessary expenditure of energy. The size and color of a bird's crown patches are better predictors of dominance (indicating which bird will avoid confrontation with another) than are the bird's size or sex. Birds with similarly sized gold crown patches are far more likely to engage in agonistic behavior than are those showing differences, and the outcomes of such confrontations can be predicted based on the color of their black stripes.

It is also believed that it is exclusively the female quetzal that broods at night.[4][14] Feeding duties are also shared equally between the sexes, with the non-brooding adult arriving with food before changing places with the brooding adult. When changing places, the adults seem to observe a ritual, with the incoming adult perching above the nest and emitting a whinnying call to signal the brooding adult to depart the nest. While brooding, the adults enter the nest to feed the nestling; when brooding ends, the adults initially continue to enter the nest but spend less time inside before leaving; at 8 days before fledging they simply lean in to feed the chick before departing; finally at 4\u20136 days before fledging the chick is able to perch on the lip of the nest and is fed from there before the adult departs.

The parrot feeds on the seeds of small grass species and several months of the year, principally those prior to the onset of the wet season, the birds are almost entirely dependent on the small but plentiful seed of firegrass (Schizachyrium fragile). An important habitat requirement is the presence of suitably sized terrestrial termite mounds, in which the birds nest. This has led to the Golden shouldered parrot and its relatives being known as the antbed parrots."}, {"0": "The golden-shouldered parrot will build a nest in the taller magnetic termite mounds (up to 2 m high) but surveys point to the preference for the lower dome type mounds. This may be to do with the slower heating up and cooling of the smaller denser mounds. Commonly they dig a burrow into the mound when wet season rains have softened the substrate of the mounds. Typically a 50 \u2013350\u00a0mm long tunnel is dug down into the mound ending in the nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3\u20136 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The termite occupants of the mound use a natural form of air conditioning to preserve the climatic conditions of their colony and this process regulates the temperature of the parrot's nest chamber at around 28\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C. Temperature surveys have shown however, a range of 13\u201335\u00a0\u00b0C. These conditions have led to the parrots developing a habit of leaving the eggs at night beginning around the 10th day after hatching. A symbiotic relationship is present between the golden shouldered parrot and the moth species Trisyntopa scatophaga, the antbed parrot moth. Found in around half of parrot nests, the moths seek out the newly dug nest tunnels and deposit their eggs in the entrance. The hatching moth larvae consume the faeces of the nestling parrots therefore helping to keep the nest chamber clean. Whether the parrots receive any other benefits from the presence of moths is arguable as not all nests contain moth larvae."}, {"0": "There appears to be a tendency for more male parrots relative to females to be born.

The main threat relates to changes to burning regimes and grazing pressure in the birds' grasslands and sparse open woodlands. Grazing pressure (by cattle and agile wallabies) and damage by feral pigs reduces important food plants, like cockatoo grass. The interaction between changed fire patterns and grazing pressure has also led to a phenomenon called \"woody thickening\", whereby native trees and shrubs outcompete the grasses. Over time, this process results in the loss of grasslands and spare open woodlands, as they become dominated by higher tree densities. The extra cover that is created by this process allow the parrot predators, such as the pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), to hunt more successfully. A number of cases have been noted where parrots raise nestlings on their own without a partner, or juveniles taking over the role of adults (that presumably have been killed). In captivity it is noted that golden-shouldered parrots will readily accept a new partner and this may be related to this wild breeding behaviour.

In 2019, the owners of Artemis - the Shephard family - started a collaboration with ecologist Steve Murphy, based at the University of Queensland. Together, Murphy and the Shephards started \"Artemis Nature Fund\" to enable practical conservation actions to take place on the property. The main actions revolve around resetting the landscape to a more open vegetation structure. Many places on Artemis have undergone severe woody thickening[7] over the past few decades. The work on Artemis centres upon resetting the ecosystem back to a more open state, which should relieve predation pressure. Between July 2021 and December 2022, approximately 60 hectares of breeding habitat had been restored by clearing. Temporary removal of cattle and reinstating former burning practices are also being used to manage habitats. Research is showing that predators are less likely to use areas once they are restored to an open structure. On-going monitoring of the parrots using colour-banding is yet to demonstrate an increase in numbers, however, monitoring during the 2022 breeding season suggested that nests were more likely to be successful if they had received management attention, in the form of clearing. Supplementary feeding has been occurring on Artemis since the early 2000s. This is designed to help birds through periods of natural food shortage, which is exacerbated by grazing pressure. It also gives birds a safer place to feed and provides researchers to monitor the survival of colour-banded birds."}, {"0": "The Golden shouldered parrot is scarce in captivity.

When the daily costs are compared to the extra nectar gained by defending a territory, territorial birds make a net energetic profit.[7] Field studies show that territorial birds need to spend less time per day foraging to meet their daily energy requirements when the flowers contain more nectar. By defending a territory a bird excludes other nectar consumers and, therefore, increases the amount of nectar available in each flower. Sunbirds satisfy their energy demands more rapidly, saving foraging time and allowing them to spend the spare time sitting on perches, which is less energetically expensive than foraging. This saving has to be weighed against the cost of defence, so if there is more than enough nectar in the flowers then it is easier just to share the nectar with other birds.[4]   When there is a minimal amount of nectar, possibly due to a bad season, the birds increase their territoriality, except when the nectar levels are too low to support cost of defence.[5]"}, {"0": "Usually territories involve only a single resident individual. Occasionally, a female can coexist with a male on a large territory and participate in its defence. Such sharing may relate to a complex prolonged pattern of pair formation. Feeding territories may be defended by all age and sex classes of the golden-winged sunbirds, including juveniles. The birds defend their territories both intra-specifically and inter-specifically against all sunbird species in the area. The success of the defence depends in part on the dominance relationships of the intruding individual, where persistent individuals of larger bird species such as the bronzy sunbird may feed successfully. Territory sizes vary greatly, ranging from 6.7 to 2300 m2, but each territory contains about the same number of flowers.[4]"}, {"0": "Sometimes, when a female golden-winged sunbird intrudes on a bronzy sunbird's territory, it performs a begging display by quivering its wings and spreading its tail.

Despite the shared plumage characteristics with the purple species, the closest extant relatives of the Goliath are considered to be the great-billed and the white-bellied herons of Southern Asia. Due to their large size, this species trio is sometimes referred to as the \"giant herons\".[7]"}, {"0": "The Goliath heron has a distinct deep bark, often described as kowoork, audible from a distances of up to 2\u00a0km.

Organ-like duetting has been reported at nest sites but has not been confirmed."}, {"0": "The Goliath heron is very aquatic, even by heron standards, rarely venturing far from a water source and preferring to fly along waterways rather than move over land. Important habitats can include lakes, swamps, mangrove wetlands, reefs with few cool water, sometimes river deltas. It typically is found in shallows, though can be observed near deep water over dense water vegetation. Goliath herons can even be found in small watering holes. They have ranged in elevation from sea level to 2,100\u00a0m (6,900\u00a0ft). They tend to prefer pristine wetlands and generally avoid areas where human disturbances are a regular occurrence."}, {"0": "Goliath herons are solitary foragers and are highly territorial towards other Goliaths entering their feeding territories.[8] On occasions, two may be seen together but these are most likely to be a breeding pair or immatures. A diurnal and often rather inactive feeder, this heron often hunts by standing in the shallows, intently watching the water at its feet. This is a typical feeding method among large Ardea herons and it can forage in deeper waters than most due to its larger size. It may also perch on heavy floating vegetation, in order to prevent water from rippling around them.[7] As prey appears, the heron rapidly spears it with open mandibles, often spearing both mandibles through the fish's body, and then swallows it whole. It is possible that the bill is used in a lure-like fashion occasionally, attracting fish to the immobile, large object submerged in the water. The handling period is long, with herons often placing their struggling prey on floating vegetation while preparing to swallow it. Due to its generally slow movements and handling time, the Goliath is frequently vulnerable to kleptoparasitism. In Africa, African fish eagles frequently pirate food caught by Goliaths, although other large birds such as saddle-billed storks and pelicans may also steal their prey."}, {"0": "Prey almost entirely consists of fish. The Goliath heron specializes in relatively large fish, with an average prey weight range of 50\u2013980\u00a0g (0.11\u20132.16\u00a0lb), averaging 500\u2013600\u00a0g (1.1\u20131.3\u00a0lb) and length of 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in). Fish exceeding 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) are usually rejected, though there is a report that the heron managed to swallow 1.4\u00a0kg (3.1\u00a0lb) fish.[9][10] Small fish are generally ignored and the average Goliath catches around 2 or 3 fish a day. Breams, mullet, tilapia and carp have locally been recorded as preferred species. Any other small animals that they come across may be eaten, including frogs, prawns, small mammals, lizards, snakes, insects and even carrion.[7][9][10]"}, {"0": "Its breeding season coincides generally with the start of the rainy season, which is around November to March. In some areas, breeding is year around, with no discernable peak season. Breeding may not occur every year. Fairly adaptable in their nesting site selection, Goliath herons generally prefer to nest on islands or islands of vegetation. The birds may abandon a nesting site if the island becomes attached to the mainland. Lakes or other large bodies of water usually hold colonies. They nest fairly low in variously sedge, reeds, bushes, trees or even on rocks or large tree stumps. The nesting dispersal seems highly variable as everything from a solitary pair (with no other Goliath nests anywhere near) to fairly large colonies have been observed, with no seeming local geographical preferences. Occasionally, they may join mixed-species colonies including other heron species, cormorants, darters, ibises and gulls. The breeding displays are not well known and may be subdued, due in part to breeding pairs possibly reunited year after year. The nests are large but often flimsy (depending on available vegetation around the nesting site), often measuring around 1 to 1.5\u00a0m (3.3 to 4.9\u00a0ft) in diameter."}, {"0": "Eggs are pale blue, averaging 72 by 54\u00a0mm (2.8 by 2.1\u00a0in) and weighing around 108\u00a0g (3.8\u00a0oz). The clutch size can range from 2 to 5 (usually 3 or 4). Incubation lasts 24 to 30 days. Although they can sometimes replace clutches, often only around 25% of eggs succeed in hatching due to various environmental conditions or predation. The young are fed by regurgitation in the nest and, after a few weeks, can bill jab and practice defensive postures against each other. At around five weeks they leave the nest completely. The parents continue to tend to them for variously 40 to 80 days. Around 62% of fledglings who successfully leave the nest survive to adulthood. Locally, the white-tailed eagle and the African fish eagle may be a predator in colonies. Despite their ponderous movements, Goliath herons can think quickly and often take flight before danger approaches. Also, due to its size and formidable bill, the full-grown Goliath heron may not have any regular predators.[7]"}, {"0": "The goliath imperial pigeon (Ducula goliath), also known as the New Caledonian imperial pigeon[2] and the notou,[3] is a species of bird in the family Columbidae.

Private dealers exported 35,315 finches, of which 14,504 were Gouldian.  The number of finches taken in the 1958 finch trapping season was the largest for one year, of the 38,649 finches taken, 11,286 were Gouldian.  The last licensed trapping of Gouldian finch in Western Australia was on 15 November 1981.  In that year's finch trapping season, of the 23,450 finches taken 1,054 were Gouldian.[25] However, it is now illegal to export these birds from Australia.[26]"}, {"0": "Black-headed female Gouldian finch"}, {"0": "Red headed male Gouldian finch at Artis Zoo, Netherlands"}, {"0": "A juvenile at Cincinnati Zoo"}, {"0": "A young Gouldian finch with the beginnings of bright adult plumage"}, {"0": "Two Gouldian finches eating birdseed"}, {"0": "White Gouldian finch and yellow Gouldian finch mutation"}, {"0": "White-breasted yellow-headed Gouldian finch (left) and black-headed male Gouldian finches"}, {"0": "Adult male double factor yellow back Gouldian finch"}, {"0": "Gould's emerald (Riccordia elegans) is an extinct species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae.

The Florida grasshopper sparrow subspecies (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) is classified as endangered by\u00a0 the USFW.[44] This subspecies hit an all time population low of 15 breeding pairs in 2017, and reported a population of 120 in 2022.[45]"}, {"0": "The majority of the former breeding range of grasshopper sparrows in North America has been converted to intensive agriculture[46] or encroached by shrubs and trees.[47] Likewise, these birds are experiencing a loss of wintering habitats, particularly within the Chihuahuan grasslands, due to similar impacts (conversion to agriculture and woody encroachment).[48] Because grasshopper sparrows require areas of dense dead grass for nesting, sparse vegetation for foraging, and little to no woody plants, they are vulnerable to management practices such as high-intensity grazing accompanied by annual burning, fire suppression leading to woody encroachment, and haying that can destroy nests if it occurs during the breeding season. Ideal grazing intensities and fire frequencies vary across their range depending on climate, but areas with moderate grazing by cattle or bison, prescribed burning every 2\u20133 years, and removal of woody plants tend to support the highest densities of grasshopper sparrows in the Southern great plains.[49]"}, {"0": "Grasshopper sparrow"}, {"0": "Grasshopper sparrow flying"}, {"0": "Juvenile grasshopper sparrow"}, {"0": "The grassland sparrow (Ammodramus humeralis) is a species of bird in the family Passerellidae.

When European explorers discovered what today are known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk and named them after this bird, although biologically, they are not closely related.[21]:\u200a10\u200a Whalers also lumped the northern and southern birds together under the common name \"woggins\".[22]"}, {"0": "Standing about 75 to 85 centimetres (30 to 33\u00a0in) tall and weighing approximately 5 kilograms (11\u00a0lb) as adult birds,[23] the flightless great auk was the second-largest member of both its family and the order Charadriiformes overall, surpassed only by the mancalline Miomancalla. It is, however, the largest species to survive into modern times. The great auks that lived farther north averaged larger in size than the more southerly members of the species.[13] Males and females were similar in plumage, although there is evidence for differences in size, particularly in the bill and femur length.[24][25][21]:\u200a8\u200a The back was primarily a glossy black, and the belly was white. The neck and legs were short, and the head and wings small.

Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections.[2] Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened by the sight of something.[19]:\u200a315\u200a They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans.[33] These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years.[19]:\u200a313\u200a During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.[21]:\u200a32"}, {"0": "The great auk was generally an excellent swimmer, using its wings to propel itself underwater.[29] While swimming, the head was held up but the neck was drawn in.[33] This species was capable of banking, veering, and turning underwater.[21]:\u200a32\u200a The great auk was known to dive to depths of 75\u00a0m (250\u00a0ft) and it has been claimed that the species was able to dive to depths of 1\u00a0km (3,300\u00a0ft; 550 fathoms).[19]:\u200a311\u200a To conserve energy, most dives were shallow.[41] It also could hold its breath for 15 minutes, longer than a seal.

Though formerly mainly just a non-breeding visitor south of Canada in North America, the species has spread to include several colonies in the New England states and now breeds as far south as North Carolina. Individuals breeding in harsher environments will migrate south, wintering on northern coasts of Europe from the Baltic Sea to southern Portugal, and regularly down to coastal Florida in North America.[20] During the winter in the Baltic Sea, the bird usually stays close to the ice boundary. North of the \u00c5land islands, the sea often freezes all the way from Sweden to Finland, and then the bird migrates to open waters.

The species also makes extensive use of dredge spoils, which, in the state of New Jersey, are their most prevalent nesting sites.[22] It generally breeds in areas free of or largely inaccessible to terrestrial predators, such as vegetated islands, sand dunes, flat-topped stacks, building roofs and sometimes amongst bushes on salt marsh islands. During the winter, the great black-backed gull often travels far out to sea to feed.[18]"}, {"0": "Great black-backed gulls are opportunistic feeders, apex predators, and are very curious. They will investigate any small organism they encounter and will readily eat almost anything that they can swallow. They get much of their dietary energy from scavenging, with refuse, most provided directly by humans, locally constituting more than half of their diet. The proliferation of garbage or refuse dumps has become a major attractant to this and all other non-specialized gull species in its range.[23][24] A study to investigate how much time they spend foraging at refuse dumps in Massachusetts found great black-backed gulls were only observed actively foraging 19% of their time there, eating less garbage than other common gulls, and spent most of their time roosting or loafing.[25]"}, {"0": "Like most gulls, Great Black-backed Gulls regularly capture fish and any fish smaller than itself found close to the surface of the water are potential prey.[18][19] Stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food.[26][27] On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents consisted of fish, but 96% of the regurgitations given to young consisted of fish.[28] Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish.[27] The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus).[27][28] Other prey often includes various squid, Jonah crabs (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity.[29][30] From observations in northern New England, 23% of observed prey was echinoderms and 63% was crustaceans.[29]"}, {"0": "Unlike most other Larus gulls, they are highly predatory and frequently hunt and kill any prey smaller than themselves, behaving more like a raptor than a typical larid gull. Lacking the razor-sharp talons and curved, tearing beak of a raptor, the great black-backed gull relies on aggression, physical strength and endurance when hunting. When attacking other animals, they usually attack seabird eggs, nestlings or fledglings at the nest, perhaps most numerously terns,[31] but also including smaller gull species as well as eiders,[32] gannets and various alcids. In Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, 10% of the stomach contents of great black-backed gulls was made up of birds, while a further 17% of stomach contents was made up of tern eggs alone.[27][28] Adult or fledged juveniles of various bird species have also been predaceously attacked. Some fully-fledged or adult birds observed to be hunted in flight or on the ground by great black-backed gulls have included Anas ducks, ruddy ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis), buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), Manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus), pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), terns, Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica), Dovekie (Alle alle), coots (Fulica ssp.), glossy ibises (Plegadis falcinellus), rock pigeons (Columba livia) and even predatory birds such as hen harriers (Circus cyaneus). When attacking other flying birds, the great black-backed gulls often pursue them on the wing and attack them by jabbing with their bill, hoping to bring down the other bird either by creating an open wound or simply via exhaustion. They may kill healthy adult birds weighing up to at least 750\u00a0g (1.65\u00a0lb) but take exclusively the small young of larger birds such as common eider (Somateria mollissima) and cormorants.[22][33][34][35][36][37][38] They will also catch flying passerines, which they typically target while the small birds are exhausted from migration and swallow them immediately.[22] Great black-backed gull also feed on land animals, including rats (Rattus ssp.) at garbage dumps, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and even sickly lambs (Ovis aries).[18][19][39]"}, {"0": "Most foods are swallowed whole, including most fish and even other gulls. When foods are too large to be swallowed at once, they will sometimes be shaken in the bill until they fall apart into pieces. Like some other gulls, when capturing molluscs or other hard-surfaced foods such as eggs, they will fly into the air with it and drop it on rocks or hard earth to crack it open. Alternate foods, including berries and insects, are eaten when available. They will readily exploit easy food sources, including chum lines made by boats at sea. They are skilled kleptoparasites who will readily pirate fish and other prey captured by other birds and dominate over other gulls when they encounter them. At tern colonies in coastal Maine, American herring gulls (L. smithsonianus) occasionally also attack nestling and fledgling terns but in a great majority of cases were immediately pirated of their catch by great black-backs.[31] In one observation, an adult great black-back was seen to rob a female peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) of a freshly caught gadwall (Anas strepera).[22] In another case, a third-year great black-back was observed fighting an adult female northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) off its kill, although the goshawk attempted to strike the gull before leaving.[40] Due to their method of using intimidation while encountering other water and raptorial birds, the species has been referred to as a \"merciless tyrant\".[19] Naturally, these gulls are attracted to the surface activity of large marine animals, from Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) to humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), to capture fish driven to the surface by such creatures.[18][19]"}, {"0": "This species breeds singly or in small colonies, sometimes in the middle of a Larus argentatus colony. Young adult pair formation occurs in March or April. The following spring the same birds usually form a pair again, meeting at the previous year's nest.

Usually a single bird does not breed in that season."}, {"0": "They make a lined nest on the ground often on top of a rocky stack, fallen log or other obstructing object which can protect the eggs from the elements. Usually, several nest scrapes are made before the one deemed best by the parents is selected and then lined with grass, seaweed or moss or objects such as rope or plastic. When nesting on roofs in urban environments, previous year's nests are often reused over and over again. The female lays usually three eggs sometime between late April and late June. When only two eggs are found in a nest, the reason is almost always that one egg, for one reason or another, has been destroyed. It takes around one week for the female to produce the three eggs, and the incubation doesn't begin until all three eggs are laid. Hence all three chicks are hatched the same day. The birds are usually successful in bringing up all the three chicks."}, {"0": "The eggs are greenish-brown with dark speckles and blotches. Both parents participate in the incubation stage, which lasts for approximately 28 days. During this time, the birds attempt to avoid being noticed and stay silent. The breeding pair are devoted parents who both take shifts brooding the young, defending the nest and gathering food. Young great black-backed gulls leave the nest area at 50 days of age and may remain with their parents for an overall period of around six months, though most fledglings choose to congregate with other immature gulls in the search for food by fall. These gulls reach breeding maturity when they obtain adult plumage at four years, though may not successfully breed until they are six years old.[18]"}, {"0": "This is a relatively long-living bird. The maximum recorded age for a wild great black-backed gull is 27.1 years.[41] This species is rarely kept in captivity, but domestically kept European herring gulls have been known to live for over 44 years and generally larger birds can outlive smaller ones.[42] Mortality typically occurs in the early stages of life, when harsh weather conditions (including flooding) and starvation can threaten them, as well as predators. Chicks and eggs are preyed on by crows (Corvus ssp.), cats (Felis catus), other gulls, raccoons (Procyon lotor) and rats (Rattus ssp.). The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus),[43] white-tailed eagle (H. albicilla) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) are the only birds known to habitually predate healthy, fully grown great black-backed gulls.[44] In one study from Norway, great black-backed gulls were the fifth highest frequency prey item for white-tailed eagles and gulls are prone to mobbing these huge eagles.[45][46] The great black-backed gull has also been observed engaging in aerial combat with bald eagles, attacking the eagles and chasing them away.[47] A great skua (Stercorarius skua) was filmed in Scotland unsuccessfully attempting to kill a second or third year great black-backed gull.[48] In Norway, great black-backed gulls have also been reported to fall prey to Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo).[49] Killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sharks also reportedly prey upon adult and juvenile birds at sea. In some biomes, where large eagles are absent the great black-backed gull may be considered the apex predator.[19]"}, {"0": "Historically, the great black-backed gull was harvested for its feathers, which were used in the hat-making trade, and this species was extirpated from large parts of its range as a result of this exploitation.[18] Today, however, its adaptability to human presence and the use of urban environments as artificial nesting sites has resulted in the great black-backed gull rapidly increasing in number and range. It is now a widespread and abundant species in its range and its numbers have increased to such high levels in some areas that it is often seen as a pest species, especially near airports where it risks collisions with airplanes, and in some coastal areas where it sometimes outcompetes or hunts rarer seabirds, such as Atlantic puffins, possibly resulting in conservationist intervention.[18] The increase and expansion of great black-backed gulls has been attributed to increasing winter fishery activities in the North Sea.[15] Although there are no known major threats to the great black-backed gull, high levels of toxic pollutants, which are ingested with contaminated prey, are often found in individuals and eggs, reducing reproductive success.

In Nova Scotia, 98% of the diet was flounder.[12] In British Columbia, the primary prey species are sticklebacks, gunnels, sculpins, and perch.[24] California herons were found to live mostly on sculpin, bass, perch, flounder, and top smelt.[25] [26][27]"}, {"0": "Besides fish, it is also known to feed on a wide range of prey opportunistically. Amphibians such as leopard frogs and American bullfrogs are readily taken, as well as reptiles such as small turtles and snakes. They can take on sizeable snakes, including water snakes 105\u00a0cm (41\u00a0in) in length.[22][28][29] Aquatic crustaceans, grasshoppers, dragonflies and aquatic insects are taken as supplementary prey.[6][30] They also prey on small mammals including shrews, rats, ground squirrels, and moles.[6] One study in Idaho showed that from 24 to 40% of the diet was made up of voles. Remains of muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) and long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata) was also found in pellets during the study.[31] There are reports that great blue heron prey on eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus).[32] Though not often, birds such as black rails (Laterallus jamaicensis), phalaropes, American dippers (Cinclus mexicanus), Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps) and chicks of marsh terns (Chlidonias) are also taken.[6][33][34]"}, {"0": "Herons locate their food by sight and usually swallow it whole. They have been known to choke on prey that is too large.[35][36] It is generally a solitary feeder. Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but also feed in fields or drop from the air, or perch, into water. Mice are occasionally preyed on in upland areas far from the species' typical aquatic environments.[20] Occasionally, loose feeding flocks form and may be beneficial since they are able to locate schools of fish more easily.[20]"}, {"0": "As large wading birds, great blue herons are capable of feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) deep,[20] or at the water's edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over the water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.[20]"}, {"0": "This species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a heronry (a more specific term than \"rookery\"). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within 4 to 5\u00a0km (2.5 to 3.1\u00a0mi), to ideal feeding spots.[20] Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and duck blinds. Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies.[37][38]"}, {"0": "Although nests are often reused for many years and herons are socially monogamous within a single breeding season, individuals usually choose new mates each year.[39] Males arrive at colonies first and settle on nests, where they court females; most males choose a different nest each year.[39] Great blue herons build a bulky stick nest. Nests are usually around 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) across when first constructed, but can grow to more than 120\u00a0cm (47\u00a0in) in width and 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) deep with repeated use and additional construction.[40] If the nest is abandoned or destroyed, the female may lay a replacement clutch. Reproduction is negatively affected by human disturbance, particularly during the beginning of nesting. Repeated human intrusion into nesting areas often results in nest failure, with abandonment of eggs or chicks. However, Vancouver B.C.

Egg weights range from 61 to 80\u00a0g (2.2 to 2.8\u00a0oz).[43] One brood is raised each year. First broods are laid generally from March to April.[44][45] Eggs are usually laid at two-day intervals, incubated  around 27 days, and hatch asynchronously over a period of several days.[39] Males incubate for about 10.5 hours of each day, while females usually incubate for the remainder of each day and the night, with eggs left without incubation for about 6 minutes of each hour.[39]"}, {"0": "The first chick to hatch usually becomes more experienced in food handling and aggressive interactions with siblings, so often grows more quickly than the other chicks.[46] Both parents feed the young at the nest by regurgitating food.

Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), American black bears (Ursus americanus), and raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to take larger nestlings or fledglings, and in the latter predator, many eggs.[11][48][49][50] In exceptional case, a young Harris's hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) killed a subadult great-blue heron.[51] Adult herons have few natural predators and are rarely preyed upon due to their large size and sharp beak, but bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) are known to attack great blue herons at every stage of their lifecycle from in the egg to adulthood.[22][52][53] And less frequently, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) are known to take adults.[54][55] There is a single report that a large bobcat (Lynx rufus) managed to subdue and kill an adult great blue heron.[56] Using its considerable size and dagger-like bill, a full-grown heron can be a formidable foe to a predator. In one instance, during an act of attempted predation by a golden eagle, a heron was able to mortally wound the eagle, although it succumbed to injuries sustained in the fight.[57] When predation on an adult or chick occurs at a breeding colony, the colony can sometimes be abandoned by the other birds.

He next cocks his tail flat along his back, exposing the normally hidden bright white plumage then he lowers his wings, with the primary flight feathers folded but with the white secondaries fanning out.[39] The displaying males, who may walk around for several minutes at a time with feathers flared and head buried waiting for hens to arrive, have been described as a \"foam-bath\" because of their appearance.[18] All breeding great bustards also moult again from June to September."}, {"0": "One to three olive or tan coloured, glossy eggs (two eggs being the average) are laid by the female in May or June. The nests, which are shallow scrapes made by the female on dry, soft slopes and plains, are usually situated close to the prior lek location. Nests are situated in sparse clusters, with a study in Inner Mongolia finding nests at a minimal 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) apart from each other. In the same study, nests were placed at mid-elevation on a hill, at about 190 to 230\u00a0m (620 to 750\u00a0ft). Nesting sites are typically in dense grassy vegetation about 15 to 35\u00a0cm (5.9 to 13.8\u00a0in), likely for protection against predation, with extensive exposure to sunlight.[40] Eggs weigh about 150\u00a0g (5.3\u00a0oz) and are on average 79.4\u00a0mm (3.13\u00a0in) tall by 56.8\u00a0mm (2.24\u00a0in) wide. The female incubates the eggs alone for 21 to 28 days. The chicks almost immediately leave the nest after they hatch, although they do not move very far from their mother until they are at least 1 year old. Young great bustards begin developing their adult plumage at about 2 months, and begin to develop flying skills at the same time. They practice by stretching, running, flapping, and making small hops and jumps to get airborne. By three months they are able to fly reasonable distances. If threatened, the young stand still, using their downy plumage, mainly sepia in colour with paler buffy streaks, as camouflage. Juveniles are independent by their first winter, but normally stay with their mother until the next breeding season. Males usually start to mate from 5 to 6 years of age, although may engage in breeding display behaviour at a younger age. Females usually first breed at 2 to 3 years old.[3][39]"}, {"0": "The species is omnivorous, taking different foods in differing seasons. In northwestern Spain in August, 48.4% of the diet of adult birds was green plant material, 40.9% was invertebrates and 10.6% was seeds. In the same population during winter, seeds and green plant material constituted almost the entirety of the diet. Alfalfa is seemingly preferred in the diet of birds from Spain.[41] Other favoured plant life in the diet can including legumes, crucifers, common dandelion and grapes and the dry seeds of wheat and barley.[3] Among animal prey, insects are generally eaten and are the main food for young bustards in their first summer, though they then switch to the seasonal herbivorous preferences of adults by winter. Coleoptera (including beetles), Hymenoptera (including bees, wasps and ants) and Orthoptera (including crickets, grasshoppers and locusts) are mainly taken, largely based on availability and abundance. Small vertebrates, including small rodents, frogs, lizards and chicks of other birds, may supplement the diet when the opportunity arises.[3][42] Great bustards may eat toxic blister beetles of the genus Meloe to self-medicate (Zoopharmacognosy)[43] increasing sexual arousal of males.[44] Some plants selected in the mating season showed in-vitro activity against laboratory models of parasites and pathogens.[45]"}, {"0": "In winter the feeding intensity increased and then decreased through the morning in both sexes, and was lower in flocks of males than in flocks of females. This sexual difference is greater where legume availability was smaller in central Spain.[46]   Males that foraged slightly less intensively than females could compensate with longer periods of foraging [47] and bigger bite size[48]  that would allow them to obtain enough food relative to their absolute daily energy requirements. The size of morning foraging area is smaller in sites with more legume availability, likely because legumes are the most preferred substrate type.[46]"}, {"0": "Great bustards typically live for around 10 years, but some have been known to live up to 15 years or more. The maximum known life span for the species was 28 years. Adult males seem to have a higher mortality rate than females due mainly to fierce intraspecies fighting with other males during the breeding season. Many males may perish in their first couple of years of maturity due to this cause.[21]"}, {"0": "Although little detailed information has been obtained of predators, over 80% of great bustards die in the first year of life and many are victims of predation. Chicks are subject to predation by the fact that they are ground-dwelling birds which are reluctant to fly. Predators of eggs and hatchlings include raptors, corvids, hedgehogs, foxes, weasels, badgers (Meles ssp.), martens (Martes ssp.), rats (Rattus ssp.) and wild boars (Sus scrofa). The most serious natural predators of nests are perhaps red foxes and hooded crows (Corvus cornix).[49] Chicks grow very quickly, by 6 months being nearly two-thirds of their adult size, and are predated by foxes, lynxes, wolves (Canis lupus), dogs, jackals and eagles.[50] Predation on adult male great bustards has been reportedly committed by white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) while golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are potential predators and eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca) have been known to prey on great bustards (but not likely to include adult males).[51][52][53] Great bustards of unspecified age and sex have been found amongst Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) prey remains in Bulgaria.[54] A possible act of predation on a great bustard was observed to be committed by a much smaller raptor, the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus), though it was likely that this bustard was \"weak or injured\" if it was taken alive.[55] The bold, conspicuous behaviour of the breeding adult male bustard may attract the same large mammalian predators that predate chicks, such as wolves and lynx, while the more inconspicuous female may sometimes be attacked by various predators. However, predation is generally fairly rare for adults due to their size, nimbleness and safety in numbers due to their social behaviour.[3][21][56][57]"}, {"0": "Occasionally, other natural causes may contribute to mortality in the species, especially starvation in harsh winter months.[56] However, major causes of mortality in recent centuries have been largely linked to human activity, as described below."}, {"0": "As of 2008, the global population numbered between 44,000 and 51,000 birds (Palacin & Alonso 2008), about 38,000 to 47,000 in Europe, with 30,000 or more than half in Spain.

There are myriad threats faced by great bustards. Increasing human disturbance could lead to habitat loss caused by the ploughing of grasslands, intensive agriculture, afforestation, increased development of irrigation schemes, and the construction of roads, power lines, fencing and ditches. Mechanisation, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, fire and predation by dogs are serious threats for chicks and juveniles, and hunting of adults contributes to high mortality in some of their range countries. Agricultural activity is a major disturbance at nest and, in Hungary, few successful nests are found outside of protected areas.[56]"}, {"0": "Bustards, despite their large size, are able to fly at high speed and are often mutilated or killed by overhead electricity cables, which are placed in the West Pannonia region of Eastern Austria and Western Hungary just at their flying height.

Cormorants consume all fish of appropriate size that they are able to catch in summer and noticeably select for larger, mostly torpedo-shaped fish in winter. Thus, the winter elevation of foraging efficiency described for cormorants by various researchers is due to capturing larger fish not due to capturing more fish.[15] In some freshwater systems, the losses of fish due to overwintering great cormorants were estimated to be up to 80\u00a0kg per ha each year (e.g. Vltava River, Czech Republic).[16]"}, {"0": "This cormorant forages by diving and capturing its prey in its beak.[13] The duration of its dives is around 28 seconds, with the bird diving to depths of about 5.8 metres (19\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in). About 60% of dives are to the benthic zone and about 10% are to the pelagic zone, with the rest of the dives being to zones in between the two.[14] Studies suggest that their hearing has evolved for underwater usage, possibly aiding their detection of fish.[17] These adaptations also have a cost on their hearing ability in air which is of lowered sensitivity.[18]"}, {"0": "Many fishermen see in the great cormorant a competitor for fish.

The diet of these juvenile birds is provided in part by food they obtained for themselves and in part from their parents. Young fledglings will also engage in play; with one bird picking up a stick and being chased by one or more other fledglings.

This macaw is able to crack open larger nuts than the sympatric scarlet macaw.[25][33][36] The beak is particularly suited for breaking open large nuts.[34] Within 50m distance from the lagoons in Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge the following plants have been recorded as food plants for the great green macaw: the palms Iriartea deltoidea, Raphia taedigera, Socratea exorrhiza and Welfia regia, the large shrub Solanum rugosum, the emergent trees Balizia elegans and Dipteryx oleifera, and the trees Byrsonima crispa, Cespedesia macrophylla, Croton schiedeanus, Dialum guianense, Guarea rhopalocarpa, Laetia procera, Maranthes panamensis, Pentaclethra macroloba, Qualea paraensis, Sacoglottis tricogyna, Vantanea barbourii, Virola koschnyi, V. sebifera and Vochysia ferruginea.[37] A major source of food in Costa Rica during breeding time is D. oleifera, 80% of the observations of foraging birds in Costa Rica in a 2004 study were in this tree (albeit in an area where this is the most common tree).[24][34] It will fly large distances to feed on these trees, also going to trees found in pastures and semi-open areas. It feeds on the trees starting in September, while the fruit is still immature, and continues feeding on them until April. In November D. oleifera forms the mainstay of the diet.[34] Sacoglottis trichogyna is the second most important food here in this period, especially when D. oleifera is not available. It feeds on this species from April to August.

Terminalia catappa, the beach almond (locally also known as almendro), is a commonly planted and naturalised tree from the old world, which these macaws have also been observed feeding on in gardens in Suerre, Costa Rica, between July and September during their migrations - they use fragments of the leaves to help scrape the flesh off the fruits in order to obtain the nuts, and depart after feeding on the trees for 40 minutes.

They will also nest in broken-topped trees and cavities in large trees. In southwestern and northeastern Oregon, the great grey owl has been using man-made platforms for nest sites since the 1980s. The erection of nest platforms for great grey owls was pioneered by Robert Nero in central Canada in the 1970s. Nesting may occur from March to May. Unlike, for example, osprey or white storks, the great grey owl does not predictably re-use nest sites over consecutive years. Four eggs are the usual clutch size. Eggs average 42.7\u00a0mm (1.68\u00a0in) wide and 53.5\u00a0mm (2.11\u00a0in) long. The incubation period is about 30\u00a0days, ranging from 28 to 36\u00a0days. Brooding lasts 2 to 3\u00a0weeks, after which the female starts roosting on a tree near nests. The young jump or fall from the nest at 3 to 4\u00a0weeks, and start to fly 1 to 2\u00a0weeks after this. Immediately after fledging, the white, fuzzy young must use beak and feet to climb back into trees. The female is on guard at this time and may be aggressive toward potential predators. Most offspring remain near their natal sites for many months after fledging. Normally the male hunts for his mate and the young throughout the nesting period. Once the young begin the fly, the female typically withdraws and the male continues to feed the young until they can hunt on their own in the autumn. The young owls go off on their own by winter."}, {"0": "The abundance of food in the area usually affects the number of eggs a female lays, a feature quite common in northern owl species. In years when small mammal populations are very low the great grey owl may not attempt nesting; thus their reproduction is connected to the sometimes extreme fluctuations of small mammal populations. Also, great grey owls may not nest in years of drought. If food is scarce, they may travel a fair distance to find more prey, with considerable movements by large numbers in some years of particularly scarce prey. Though they do not migrate, many are at least somewhat nomadic."}, {"0": "One alert landowner in northeast Oregon, Andy Huber, helped a female great grey owl raise her four nestlings after a great horned owl killed the male.

They frequently hunt from a low listening post which can be a stump, low tree limb, fence post, or road sign. Their large facial disks, also known as \"ruffs\", focus sound, and the asymmetrical placement of their ears assists them in locating prey, because of the lack of light during the late and early hours in which they hunt. On the nesting grounds, they mainly hunt at night and near dawn and dusk; at other times, they are active mostly during the night."}, {"0": "They have excellent hearing, and may locate (and then capture) prey moving beneath 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft) of snow in a series of tunnels solely with that sense.

What species they eat depends on which small mammals are most abundant and available. In northern Canada and other parts of Scandinavia, they eat lemmings primarily. In dry parts of California's Sierra Nevada they eat mostly pocket gophers. In some areas voles are the predominant prey. Locally, alternative prey animals (usually comprising less than 20% of prey intake) include hares, moles, shrews, weasels, thrushes, grouse, Canada jays, mountain quail, small hawks and ducks.

In mated pairs, the male is the primary hunter who provides food for the entire family while the female guards and broods the eggs, nestlings, and flightless fledglings."}, {"0": "The harvest of timber from the great grey owl's habitat is, perhaps, the greatest threat to this species.[13] Intensified timber management typically reduces live and dead large-diameter trees used for nesting, leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly, and dense canopy closures in stands used by juveniles for cover and protection.[13] If perches are not left in clearcuts, great grey owls cannot readily hunt in them. Although human-made structures (made specifically for use by this species) have been utilized by these owls, the species is far more common in areas protected from logging. Livestock grazing in meadows also adversely affects great grey owls, by reducing habitat for preferred prey species.[13]"}, {"0": "Other dangers to great grey owls include rodenticides, collisions with vehicles, and the West Nile Virus.

Use of the former by Conrad Gessner established the quasi-scientific term lanius for the shrikes. Linnaeus chose his specific name because the species \"observes approaching hawks and announces [the presence] of songbirds\"[6] as he put it. This habit was also put to use in falconry, as fancifully recorded by William Yarrell later.[7] The common English name \"shrike\" is from Old English scr\u00edc, \"shriek\", referring to the shrill call.[8]"}, {"0": "Ulisse Aldrovandi, Conrad Gessner, John Ray and Francis Willughby also reported old folk names, mainly from Germanic languages: Wereangel or Wierangel from the Pennines of England (where the bird was noted as a vagrant) as well as Warkangel, Werkengel or Wurchangel in various German dialects (e.g. around Frankfurt and Strasbourg) probably mean \"choking angel\" (cf. Standard German W\u00fcrgeengel). These names are unlikely to significantly pre-date the times of Saint Boniface (c. 700 AD) because of their Christian connotation; the related Werkenvogel (\"choking bird\") might, however, do so. The English version, having become wariangle or weirangle, was eventually transferred to the native red-backed shrike (L. collurio) and lingered on into modern times in Yorkshire. Along the upper Rhine, between Strasbourg and Heidelberg for example, Linkenom is attested; its origin is unclear. Low German Neghen-doer and Middle German N\u00fcnm\u00f6rder were also used; this has today evolved into Neunt\u00f6ter and specifically means the red-backed shrike, but could in earlier times refer to any native Lanius.

Shrike, meanwhile, is of Germanic origin also and dates back at least to Middle or Early Modern English schricum. This is related to such words as Norwegian and Swedish skrika (\"shriek, skrike\"), German Schrei (\"scream\") or Icelandic shrikja (\"shrieker\"). But it seems to have become the dominant term only in rather recent times, for as late as the 18th century, the species was still widely known as \"greater butcher-bird\" in English, just like it was known as the boucher (\"butcher\") in the French Jura. In Norway a vernacular name for the bird is varsler.[9] A whimsical name \u2013 presumably from Scotland or nearby England \u2013 was \"white wisky John\" in reference to its wavy and somewhat unelegant flight, during which its large areas of light plumage are conspicuous.[10]"}, {"0": "The \"grey shrike\" is also sometimes named \"gray shrike.\"[11]"}, {"0": "The shrike family (Laniidae) is a member of the Corvoidea, the most ancient of the four large songbird superfamilies. Among its superfamily, the closest relatives of the Laniidae are probably the Corvidae (crows and allies). Little reliable data exists on its evolution; certainly (even though the supposed ancestral shrike \"Lanius\" miocaenus might not belong in the Laniidae, and probably does not belong in the same genus as L. excubitor) the genus dates back to Miocene times. A Lanius fossil from the Late Miocene Turolian age, c. 6 million years ago, has been found at Polg\u00e1rdi, Hungary. Its relationship to the modern species is unclear. However, all things considered, the grey shrike lineage probably represents the Holarctic sister to the African radiation of fiscal shrikes. These two seem to have originated in a west- or southwestward expansion from the genus' origin, which (considering the biogeography of living Lanius lineages) was probably somewhere between Asia Minor and central Asia. At the time of the Polg\u00e1rdi fossil, it is rather likely that the grey shrikes were a distinct lineage already; given that they and the fiscals generally follow Bergmann's Rule, the smallish fossil makes an unlikely ancestor to the large grey shrikes even when taking into account the somewhat warmer Miocene climate.[12]"}, {"0": "The grey shrike superspecies consists of L. excubitor and its parapatric southern relatives.

The centre of this group's radiation is probably in the eastern Mediterranean region, and the southern grey shrike represents the basalmost form. The other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions. This must have happened fairly recently, because lineage sorting is not complete in the grey shrikes, and most of the present-day habitat of L. excubitor was uninhabitable during much of the Quaternary glaciation.

The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, and pointed at the tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner than the rest of the light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the under mandible (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.[17]"}, {"0": "Males and females are about the same size, and do not differ conspicuously in appearance except by direct comparison. In the female the underparts are greyer and are usually visibly barred greyish-brown, and the white wing and tail markings are characteristically less in extent (though this is rarely clearly visible except in flight). Fledged young birds are heavily tinged greyish-brown all over, with barring on the upperside and indistinct buffy-white markings. The tips of the tertiary remiges and the wing coverts are also buffy, with a black band in the latter. In the North American subspecies borealis, the fledglings are tinged quite brown indeed on upperside and wings, and have sharp and dark underside bars. In Eurasia, fledglings moult into a female-like plumage with the tertiary bars usually remaining in autumn. Across its range, the young acquire the adult plumage in their first spring.[18]"}, {"0": "The male's song consists of short pleasant warbling strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles.

To announce that it has become aware of someone straying into its territory \u2013 be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal \u2013 it gives long shrill raspy whistles like trrii(u) or (t')kwiiet. To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like tr\u00fc\u00fc(t). These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as chlie(p), gihrrr, kw\u00e4 or wuut. These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship.

Their overall colouration is \u2013 apparently plesiomorphically \u2013 shared in sub-Saharan Africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey-backed fiscal (L. excubitoroides) which is found from the Sahel eastwards, and Mackinnon's fiscal (L. mackinnoni) of the Congo Basin region. The lesser grey shrike (L. minor, Balkans to Central Asia) seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike superspecies between Eastern Europe and Central Asia; it may be more closely related to the small brown shrikes and resemble the bold, aggressive and hard-to-catch grey shrikes because of Batesian mimicry.[22]"}, {"0": "The Iberian grey shrike is clearer and usually darker grey above, and not tinged grey but often decidedly pinkish on the belly and particular breast; the white \"eyebrow\" extends to over the beak, which has typically a larger pale base.

It can best be recognized by the rather large black area above the bill, almost reaching to the forehead and without a white stripe above it. In flight, the wide instead of pointed black tail end of L. minor is characteristic. The African species are completely allopatric with L. excubitor; they lack white scapulars (grey-backed fiscal) or wingspots (Mackinnon's fiscal) and differ in some other details, particularly the tail pattern.[26]"}, {"0": "Generally, its breeding range is found in Eurasia and northern Africa. In the high mountains of the Altai-Tian Shan region, it ranges south perhaps as far as 42\u00b0 northern latitude. Its northern limit is generally 70\u00b0 northern latitude. It is only found as a vagrant in Iceland, the British Isles, the Mediterranean region (excluding the Iberian Peninsula and perhaps Romania but including Cyprus), and Korea. There do not appear to be breeding records from the entire Kamchatka Peninsula; in Switzerland, the present day Netherlands and southern Germany small populations were found in the mid-20th century but have declined or even disappeared since then.[27]"}, {"0": "Except for the subspecies bianchii which is largely all-year resident, and subspecies excubitor in the temperate European parts of its range with their mild maritime climate, the species is a short-distance migrant. The migrations are triggered by scarcity of food and therefore, according to prey population levels, the winter range might little extend south beyond the breeding range, or be entirely parapatric to it. The populations of the Central Asian mountains mostly migrate downslope rather than southwards. Females are more prone to migration than males; they do not appear to migrate, on average, longer or shorter distances than males, and consequently are the dominant sex in many parts of the winter range. Birds leave for winter quarters a more or less short time after breeding \u2013 July to October, with most birds staying to September \u2013 and return to nest mainly in March/April, but some only arrive in May. In recent decades, the number of birds remaining on the breeding grounds all year has been noted to increase e.g. in Fennoscandia, whereas for example borealis seems to be as rare a winter visitor in northern Ohio as it was a century ago.[2][28][29]"}, {"0": "The preferred habitat is generally open grassland, perhaps with shrubs interspersed, and adjacent lookout points. These are normally trees \u2013 at forest edges in much of the habitat, but single trees or small stands at the taiga-tundra border. In steppe, it will utilize any isolated perch, be it fence posts, power lines or rocks. In general, some 5\u201315 perching sites per hectare habitat seem to be required. It avoids low grassland with no lookouts and nesting opportunities (trees or large shrubs), as well as dense forest with no hunting ground. Apart from grassland, the birds will utilize a variety of hunting habitats, including bogs, clearings or non-industrially farmed fields. Breeding birds appear to have different microhabitat desires, but little detail is known yet.[30]"}, {"0": "This species is territorial, but likes to breed in dispersed groups of a good half-dozen adults. It is not known to what extent the birds in such groups are related. In the temperate parts of its range, groups are perhaps 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) apart, while individual territories within each group may be as small as 20\u00a0ha (49 acres) but more typically are about twice that size. In less hospitable climes, territories may be more than 350\u00a0ha (1.4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Throughout the breeding season, in prime habitat, territories are held by mated pairs and single males looking for a partner. In less productive habitat, \"floaters\" hold territories more ephemerally. This leads to shifts in population density between regions, as \"floaters\" move between groups of territorial birds in search of a bountiful unclaimed territory to settle down and/or a partner to mate with. On the wintering grounds, pairs separate to account for the lower amount of food available at that time, but if both members migrate they tend to have their wintering grounds not far apart. As it seems, once an individual great grey shrike has found a wintering territory it likes, it will return there subsequently and perhaps even try to defend it against competitors just like a summer territory. Throughout the year, the birds regularly but briefly move through a range up to three times larger than their territory; this is tolerated by territory owners in winter more easily than in summer, and the parts of Europe where all-year residents and winter visitors co-occur typically have population densities around eight[verification needed] birds/km2 (about thirty[verification needed] per square mile) and occasionally more in winter.[31]"}, {"0": "Before and after the nesting season, groups of breeding birds will sometimes initiate gatherings; these seem to occur at the boundary of the group's combined range or in the unclaimed land separating it from neighbouring groups. The initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory: it spirals tens of meters/yards high into the air, usually briefly does a fluttering hover at the top of the spiral, and then glides down. Group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight, and eventually about half the group's members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes \u2013 sometimes more than an hour \u2013 chattering, calling, duetting, and excitedly moving about the meeting site (which typically is some small tree or shrubbery). In winter, birds will often assemble in small groups and roost together, particularly to keep warm during the night; this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however.[32]"}, {"0": "The flight of the great grey shrike is undulating and rather heavy, but its dash is straight and determined. It is, as noted above, also capable of hovering flights, which last briefly but may be repeated time after time because of the birds' considerable stamina. It will usually stay low above the ground in flight, approaching perches from below and landing in an upward swoop. In social interactions, birds signal an aggressive stance by a bold upright posture, fanning and then flicking the tail and eventually the wings also as the bird gets more excited. It signals its readiness to strike at an intruder by shifting to a horizontal pose and fluffing its feathers, raising them into a small crest along the top of the head. Birds appease conspecifics by head-turns away from them (if close by), or by imitating the crouching fluttering pose and calls given by fledglings begging for food (if sitting father apart). The submission gesture to prevent an imminent attack by a conspecific is pointing the beak straight up.[33]"}, {"0": "Fledgelings moult part of their juvenile plumage before their first winter, and the rest in spring. Adults moult on their breeding grounds before going on migration, or before the depth of winter if they are resident. Sometimes adults also seem to moult some feathers before attempting to breed. As moult requires a considerable investment of energy, some significant evolutionary benefits to offset this are likely. Reducing feather wear and parasite load, moulting can make a bird more physically attractive and healthy, and may thus increase its chance of successful reproduction. The phenomenon is not well understood, however.[2]"}, {"0": "The great grey shrike eats small vertebrates and large invertebrates. To hunt, this bird perches on the topmost branch of a tree, utility pole or similar elevated spot in a characteristic upright stance some metres/yards (at least one and up to 18\u00a0m/20\u00a0yd) above ground. Alternatively, it may scan the grassland below from flight, essentially staying in one place during prolonged bouts of mainly hovering flight that may last up to 20 minutes. It will drop down in a light glide for terrestrial prey or swoop hawk-like on a flying insect. Small birds are sometimes caught in flight too, usually by approaching them from below and behind and seizing their feet with the beak. If no prey ventures out in the open, great grey shrikes will rummage through the undergrowth or sit near hiding places and flash their white wing and tail markings to scare small animals into coming out. As noted above, it will sometimes mimic songbirds to entice them to come within striking distance.[32]"}, {"0": "Typically, at least half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and sometimes young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, other passerines,[34] lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, newts and salamanders, and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles (e.g. ground beetles, dung beetles, rove beetles, and darkling beetles),[35] crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions, crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.[31][36]"}, {"0": "Prey is killed by hitting it with the hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in one or a few chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by carrying it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point \u2013 thorns or the barbs of barbed wire \u2013 or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them \u2013 by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head \u2013 to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.[32][36]"}, {"0": "The basic metabolic rate of the great grey shrike is around 800 milliwatts, or somewhat more than 11 milliwatts per gram of body mass. An adult of this species needs about 50\u00a0g (1.8\u00a0oz) of prey a day, probably somewhat more in winter. Under most circumstances, this would thus translate to one or two rodents, one or two additional vertebrate prey animals (including rodents), and up to a single vertebrate prey item's worth of invertebrates. Surplus food may be impaled for storage. These \"larders\" are typically around 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) above ground and can be found anywhere within the birds' territory, but tend to be rather in the general vicinity of nest sites than far away from them.[32][37]"}, {"0": "Great grey shrikes breed during the summer, typically once per year. In exceptionally good conditions, they raise two broods a year, and if the first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one. Their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter; birds often choose a different mate than the year before. To seek out potential mates, males will venture outside their breeding territories. If a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking, she will visit to see whether they get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer. The courtship period is generally longer than in the Iberian grey shrike (L. meridionalis), usually starting about March and lasting to April/May. At first, the female rebuffs the male, only allowing him to feed her. Males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and turning away from the female. He also occasionally turns to sit at a right angle to her. Eventually, the female will join in the male's displays, and the songs will become duets. To feed females and to show off their hunting prowess, males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time. When presenting nesting sites, males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail.[38]"}, {"0": "Copulation is typically initiated by the male bringing an attractive prey item to the female. With both giving begging calls, they approach until they are side by side. The male then raises and swings his body left and right a few times, and passes the prey to the female, followed by the actual copulation. The gatherings of neighbour groups (see above) cease when nesting is underway, and when the eggs are nearly ready to lay, the male guards his partner closely, perching higher than her to watch for threats and frequently feeding her. This apparently ensures her physical well-being rather than preventing extra-pair copulations, as neighbouring males will stray through each other's territory to snatch a quick fling with the resident females. In this, they have almost a one-in-three chance of success, and consequently the average grey shrike nest is very likely to contain offspring of more than one male. Females may deposit their eggs in neighbours' nests, but this seems to occur more rarely; in general, mated females are fairly reclusive after their eggs have started developing. A full clutch of eggs can be produced by a female in about 10\u201315 days.[38]"}, {"0": "Nests are built in April or May more than 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) above ground in trees. This height varies according to habitat, but while nests have been found almost 40\u00a0m (44\u00a0yd) up, most are 2\u201316\u00a0m above ground. Presence of mistletoes or vines like common ivy (Hedera helix) on side branches near the trunk (where nests are preferentially built) will make a tree markedly more attractive. Fieldfares (Turdus pilaris) nesting in the vicinity will also increase the desirability of nest sites to great grey shrikes, which moreover often refuse to prey upon these thrushes' nestlings though the opportunity is there. Apparently, the two species are more efficient in spotting potential nest predators \u2013 in particular corvids \u2013 early on and mobbing them off cooperatively than either is on its own. Otherwise, there is no clear preference for particular taxa of nesting trees, provided they are sufficiently dense. Conifers seem to have become more popular with European L. excubitor in recent decades, but a diversity of deciduous trees is used just as well. Far more rarely, large and especially thorny shrubs are used for nesting. The actual nesting site is chosen by the male; the courtship visits of the female are mainly to form and strengthen the pair bond. Also, though the partners build the nest together, the male collects most of the nesting material. The cup nest is quite sizable, measuring 20\u201328\u00a0cm (7.9\u201311.0\u00a0in) in outer diameter. Its body is constructed of coarse vegetable material \u2013 mainly large twigs and chunks of moss, though bits of fabric and rubbish may be added. The interior cup is 8\u201312\u00a0cm (3.1\u20134.7\u00a0in) in diameter and 10\u201315\u00a0cm (3.9\u20135.9\u00a0in) deep; it is lined with fine twigs and roots, lichen, hair and feathers. Building a nest from scratch takes a pair one to two weeks, but if nests of the previous year in good locations remain usable, they are repaired rather than discarded.[39]"}, {"0": "Laying usually takes place in May. The clutch numbers three to nine eggs, typically around seven, with North American clutches tending to be larger on average than European ones. If a second clutch is produced in one breeding season, it is smaller than the first one. The eggs have a white background colour, usually with a grey hue and sometimes with a blue one; they are patterned with blotches of yellowish- to reddish-brown and purplish-grey, often denser around the blunt end. They measure around 26\u00a0mm (1.0\u00a0in) in length and 19.5\u00a0mm (0.77\u00a0in) in width. Incubation takes around 16 days but may be closer to three weeks for large clutches; it is generally done only by the female. While the male may briefly take over incubating, his task during this time is to provide food. The altricial nestlings hatch naked, blind and pink-skinned, weighing c. 4\u00a0g (0.14\u00a0oz); their skin turns darker after a few days. The inside of their beak is pink and they probably lack spots or other prominent marks; the wattles at the corners of the mouth are yellow as in many passerines. As the nestlings grow, the female broods them, and later on assists in providing food. The young fledge after 2\u20133 weeks, typically in late June or early July; they become independent of their parents about 3\u20136 weeks later. Sometimes, a parent will single out particular fledglings (possibly the weakest ones) and focus their care and feeding on these during this time. Other adults have occasionally been recorded assisting in feeding a pair's offspring; it is not clear whether these helpers at the nest are offspring of previous years, or unrelated non-breeding \"floaters\" or breeding neighbours.[37][39]"}, {"0": "Common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) have been noted as regular brood parasites of L. e. excubitor in the past; for reasons unknown this has ceased since the late 1970s or so. It may well be that the cuckoo's gens laying eggs similar to those of the great grey shrike has become extinct. Among predators of eggs and nestlings, corvids (Corvidae) \u2013 extremely close relatives of the shrikes (Laniidae) as it happens[40] \u2013 are most significant.[39]"}, {"0": "Usually more than half of all nests manage to hatch at least one young, and around three-quarters of all eggs laid hatch, suggesting that if eggs are lost before hatching, it usually is the entire clutch. Half to three-quarters of the hatched young successfully fledge under most circumstances. They will become sexually mature in their first spring and often attempt to breed right away. On average, great grey shrikes get a chance at four breeding attempts during their life, with most birds in the wild getting eaten by a bird of prey or carnivorous mammal or dying of other causes before the end of their fifth winter. Raptorial birds are the main threat to shrikes after fledging, with regular predators including species as small as little owls (which are close to the same size as the shrike).[41] The maximum documented lifespan, however, is 12 years.[37][42]"}, {"0": "As remarked above, the great grey shrike has apparently become extinct as a breeding bird in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Overall, its stocks seem to be declining in the European part of its range since the 1970s. The increase and decline seem to be reactions to changing land use, with an increase as the number of agricultural workers declined after World War II and land fell fallow, declining again when land consolidation (see e.g. Flurbereinigung) had seriously depleted the number of hedgerows and similar elevated growth formerly common amidst the agricultural landscape. For such a predatory bird, the indiscriminate use of pesticides (which will accumulate in adult carnivores and inhibit breeding success) around the 1960s probably had a detrimental influence on stocks too.[30]"}, {"0": "Altogether, the great grey shrike is common and widespread and not considered a threatened species by the IUCN (though they still include L. meridionalis in L. excubitor).

A congregation of 150 to 200 birds has been recorded in southeastern Bhutan.[13] In the wild, the great hornbill's diet consists mainly of fruit. Figs are particularly important as a food source.[23] Vitex altissima has been noted as another important food source. Great hornbills also forage on lipid-rich fruits of the families Lauraceae and Myristicaceae such as Persea, Alseodaphne and Myristica.[24] They obtain water entirely from their diet of fruits. They are important dispersers of many forest tree species.[25] They will also eat small mammals, birds,[26] small reptiles and insects.[27] Lion-tailed macaques have been seen to forage alongside these hornbills.[28]"}, {"0": "They forage along branches, moving along by hopping, looking for insects, nestling birds and small lizards, tearing up bark and examining them.

They make loud duets, beginning with a loud \"kok\" given about once a second by the male, to which the female joins in. The pair then calls in unison, turning into a rapid mixture of roars and barks.[29] They prefer mature forests for nesting. Large, tall and old trees, particularly emergents that rise above the canopy, seem to be preferred for nesting.[30][31] They form monogamous pair bonds and live in small groups of 2-40 individuals. Group courtship displays involving up to 20 birds have been observed.[32]"}, {"0": "The female hornbill builds a nest in the hollow of a large tree trunk, sealing the opening with a plaster made up mainly of feces.[6][33][34] She remains imprisoned there, relying on the male to bring her food, until the chicks are half developed. During this period the female undergoes a complete moult. The young chicks have no feathers and appear very plump. The mother is fed by her mate through a slit in the seal. The clutch consists of one or two eggs, which she incubates for 38\u201340 days. The female voids feces through the nest slit, as do the chicks from the age of two weeks.[29] Once the female emerges from the nest, the chicks seal it again.[7]"}, {"0": "The young birds have no trace of a casque.

It is an extremely adaptable bird with a vast range and is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas.[4] Its primary diet is rabbits and hares, rats and mice, and voles, although it freely hunts any animal it can overtake, including rodents and other small mammals, larger mid-sized mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. In ornithological study, the great horned owl is often compared to the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), a closely related species, which despite the latter's notably larger size, occupies the same ecological niche in Eurasia, and the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), with which it often shares similar habitat, prey, and nesting habits by day, thus is something of a diurnal ecological equivalent.[5] The great horned owl is one of the earliest nesting birds in North America, often laying eggs weeks or even months before other raptorial birds.[6]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the other owls in the genus Strix and coined the binomial name Strix virginia.[7] Gmelin based his description on that of English naturalist George Edwards who had described and illustrated the great horned owl in 1747 in the second volume of his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds. Edwards had seen a live specimen from Virginia at the house of the Earl of Burlington in Chiswick. Edwards also owned a preserved specimen, and another specimen formed part of the Leverian collection.[8] The great horned owl  is now placed in the genus Bubo that was introduced in 1805 by Andr\u00e9 Dum\u00e9ril.[9][10]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl represents one of the one or two radiations of the genus across the Bering land bridge to the Americas. Whereas the Magellanic horned owl clearly divided once the owl had spread through the Americas, the consensus seems to be that the snowy owl and the great horned owl divided back in Eurasia and the snowy then spread back over the Arctic through northernmost North America separately from the radiation of the horned owl.[11][12] The great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls may in fact be conspecifics, based on similarities in life history, geographic distribution, and appearance.[5] In one case, a zoo-kept male great horned owl and female Eurasian eagle-owl produced an apparently healthy hybrid.[13] Genetic testing indicates that the snowy owl, not the Eurasian eagle-owl, is the most closely related living species.[11] Pleistocene era fossils have been found of Bubo owls in North America, which may either be distinct species or paleosubspecies, from as far east as Georgia, but predominantly in the Rocky Mountains and to the west of them.[14][15] Almost all fossils indicate these owls were larger than modern great horned owls.[16][17]"}, {"0": "A large number of subspecies, more than 20 altogether, have been named. However, many of these are not true subspecies and only examples of individual or clinal variation.

The white throat may continue as a streak running down the middle of the breast even when the birds are not displaying, which in particularly pale individuals can widen at the belly into a large white area. South American great horned owls typically have a smaller white throat patch, often unseen unless actively displaying, and rarely display the white area on the chest.[5] Individual and regional variations in overall color occur, with birds from the subarctic showing a washed-out, light-buff color, while those from the Pacific Coast of North America, Central America, and much of South America can be a dark brownish color overlaid with blackish blotching. The skin of the feet and legs, though almost entirely obscured by feathers, is black. Even tropical great horned owls have feathered legs and feet.

The purpose of plumicorns is not fully understood, but the hypothesis that they serve as a visual cue in territorial and sociosexual interactions with other owls is generally accepted.[5]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl is the heaviest extant owl in Central and South America and is the second-heaviest owl in North America, after the closely related, but very different-looking snowy owl.[6][11] It is heavily built, with a barrel-shaped body, a large head, and broad wings.[11] Its size can vary considerably across its range, with populations in interior Alaska and Ontario being largest and populations in California and Texas being smallest, though those from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Baja California appear to be even smaller.[19][20] Adult great horned owls range in length from 43 to 64\u00a0cm (17 to 25\u00a0in), with an average of 55\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), and possess a wingspan of 91 to 153\u00a0cm (3\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in to 5\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in), with an average of 122\u00a0cm (48\u00a0in). Females are somewhat larger than males.[14][21] Mean body weight is 1,608\u00a0g (3.545\u00a0lb) for females and 1,224\u00a0g (2.698\u00a0lb) for males.[22][23] Depending on subspecies, maximum weight can reach 2,503\u00a0g (5.518\u00a0lb).[24]"}, {"0": "The wing chord length is 297\u2013400\u00a0mm (11.7\u201315.7\u00a0in).[25] The wing loading, the measured wing area compared to weight, is high, meaning the wings are relatively small in surface area for the bird's weight; the species' wing loading has been described as proportionately the highest among raptors.[18][26] The tail, being relatively short as is typical of most owls, is 175 to 252\u00a0mm (6.9 to 9.9\u00a0in) long. Like other owl species, the great horned owl is capable of \u201csilent flight\u201d, which is the way owls fly while making almost no discernable noise, despite their large size. This is made possible thanks to three main components of the owl's wing structure. The leading edge of their feathers have serrations that help to disrupt the turbulence generated by wing flapping, then the softer feathers help deaden the sound, and finally the trailing fringe of the feathers that works to finish cutting the sounds made by flight. The structure of the great horned owl wing also allows it to fly at a very low speeds for the size of the species, as slow as 2 miles per hour when they are gliding on breezes.[27]"}, {"0": "The legs, feet, and talons are large and powerful. Tarsal length is 54\u201380\u00a0mm (2.1\u20133.1\u00a0in).[11] The average foot span of a fully spread foot, from talon to talon, is around 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in), as compared to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) in long-eared owls, 13 to 15\u00a0cm (5.1 to 5.9\u00a0in) in barn owls, and 18\u00a0cm (7.1\u00a0in) in the great grey owl.[5][28] Great horned owls can apply at least 300 lb/in2 of crushing power in their talons, a pressure considerably greater than the human hand is capable of exerting. In some big females, the gripping power of the great horned owl may be comparable to much larger raptor species such as the golden eagle.[29]"}, {"0": "The hard, inflexible bill of the great horned owl is 3.3\u20135.2\u00a0cm (1.3\u20132.0\u00a0in) long, although the culmen, the exposed bill portion as measured along the top of the beak, is only 2.1 to 3.3\u00a0cm (0.83 to 1.30\u00a0in).[30]"}, {"0": "The outer ear openings, which are concealed by feathers on the sides of the head, are relatively smaller than those of the Eurasian eagle owl, being 2.3\u00a0cm (0.91\u00a0in) in vertical axis, with the left ear slightly larger than the right.[31] Like most exclusively (or near exclusively) nocturnal species, the great horned owl has asymmetrical ear holes that allow for the triangulation of sounds when hunting in the dark. The different-height holes, while still close together, are differentiated enough that the owl is able to use the timing and direction of the sound waves hitting each hole to precisely locate prey even if the prey is located under cover such as snow. The disc-like shape of their faces also helps to direct the sounds they hear toward their ears. While the true nature/purpose of the ear tufts that are present on the great horned owl is unknown, researchers agree that the tufts do not play any role in the hearing ability of the owl. It is estimated that their hearing is up to ten times that of a human being.[32]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl's eyes, just slightly smaller than the eyes of a human being, are large even for an owl and rank proportionately among the largest eyes of all terrestrial vertebrates.[33] The great horned owl has cylindrical eyes which creates more distance from the lens of the eye to the retina, which allows it to act more like a telephoto lens for farther distance sight compared to that possible from round eyes.[34] They are visually highly adapted for nocturnal hunting and provide a wide, almost completely binocular field of view, a large corneal surface and a predominantly rod retina.[35] The great horned owl's eye contains both rods and cones like most species that see in color, but the vision of a great horned owl closely resembles that of many other nocturnal species. The peak wavelengths that are observed by the cones is 555\u00a0nm and the research suggests that the great horned owl has relatively weak color vision, especially compared to other bird species. Despite (or perhaps as a result of) the poorer sense of color vision, the owl manages to have excellent night vision.[36] Instead of turning its eyes, an owl must turn its whole head, and the great horned owl can rotate its neck 270\u00b0. The iris is yellow, except in the amber-eyed South American great horned owl (B. v. nacurutu)."}, {"0": "The great horned owl's song is normally a low-pitched but loud ho-ho-hoo hoo hoo (or also transcribed as bu-bubu booh, who-hoo-ho-oo or who-ho-o-o, whoo-hoo-o-o, whoo) and can last for four or five syllables. The call is resonant and has warranted descriptions as varied as \"solemn\" and \"terrifying\".[5][6] The female's call is higher and rises in pitch at the end of the call. Female vocalizations are higher in pitch because of a smaller syrinx in the larger sex.[37] Calling seems to peak after rather than before midnight.[38][39] Usually, territorial hooting decreases in February or March at the onset of egg laying.[40] On occasion, this species exhibits \"an indescribable assemblage of hoots, chuckles, screeches, and squawks, given so rapidly and disconnectedly that the effect is both startling and amusing\".[41] Descriptions of some of these odd sounds including a growling krrooo-ooo note pair, a laughing whar, whah, wha-a-a-a-ah, a high-pitched ank, ank, ank; a weak, soft erk, erk, a cat-like meee-owwwwww, a hawk-like note of ke-yah, ke-yah, and a nighthawk-like peent. These vocalizations may be variously uttered when the birds are disturbed and angered at the nest (frequently preceding an attack on an interloping human or other animal), represent the vocal development of young owls, or are given during courtship and during territorial disputes with other owls.[6][14][42] Young owls still in the care of their parents make loud, persistent hissing or loud, piercing screeching sounds that are often confused with the calls of the barn owl.[11]"}, {"0": "The combination of the species' bulk, prominent ear tufts and barred plumage distinguishes it through much of the range, but it may be easily confused with the lesser or Magellanic horned owl (B. magellanicus), which may overlap in range.[11] The Magellanic horned owl was once considered a subspecies of the great horned, but is now almost universally considered a distinct species, as is supported by genetic materials, with the great horned being the paraspecies.[11][18] Overall coloration is similar, but the Magellanic is markedly smaller with smaller feet and a smaller head, with finer, but more numerous brownish bars on the underside, rather than the blotchy, irregular barring typical of great horned owls.[11] Other eagle-owls may superficially be somewhat similar, but the species is generically allopatric with the exception of wintering snowy owls. More tropical species with ear tufts, the stygian owl (A. stygius) and striped owl (A. clamator), are much smaller.[11] Other large owls lack ear tufts.[5]"}, {"0": "The breeding habitat of the great horned owl extends high into the subarctic of North America, where they are found up to the northwestern and southern Mackenzie Mountains, Keewatin, Ontario, northern Manitoba, Fort Chimo in Ungava, Okak, Newfoundland and Labrador, Anticosti Island and Prince Edward Island. They are distributed throughout most of North America and very spottily in Central America and then down into South America south to upland regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, before they give way to the Magellanic horned owl, which thence ranges all the way to Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of the continent. It is absent or rare from southern Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica to Panama (where only two records) in Central America and the mangrove forests of northwestern South America. The species is also absent from the West Indies, the Haida Gwaii and almost all off-shore islands in the Americas, its ability to colonize islands apparently being considerably less than those of barn owls and short-eared owls.[5][44][46][55][56] Since the division into two species, the great horned owl is the second most widely distributed owl in the Americas, just after the barn owl.[11]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl is among the world's most adaptable owls or even bird species in terms of habitat. The great horned owl can take up residence in trees that border all manner of deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests, tropical rainforests, pampas, prairie, mountainous areas, deserts, subarctic tundra, rocky coasts, mangrove swamp forests, and some urban areas.[11] It is less common in the more extreme areas of the Americas. In the Mojave and Sonora Deserts, they are absent from the heart of the deserts and are only found on the vegetated or rocky fringes. Even in North America, they are rare in landscapes including more than 70% old-growth forest, such as the aspen forest of the Rockies.[14][57] They have only been recorded a handful of times in true rainforests such as the Amazon rainforest.[5] In the Appalachian Mountains, they appear to use old-growth forest[58] but in Arkansas are actually often found near temporary agricultural openings in the midst of large areas of woodland.[59] Similarly in south-central Pennsylvania, the owls use cropland and pasture more than deciduous and total forest cover, indicating preference for fragmented landscapes.[60] In prairies, grasslands and deserts, they can successfully live year round as long as there are rocky canyons, steep gullies and/or wooded coulees with shade-giving trees to provide them shelter and nesting sites.[5][61]"}, {"0": "In mountainous areas of North America, they are usually absent above the tree line, but great horned owls can be found up to 2,100\u00a0m (6,900\u00a0ft) in California and 3,300\u00a0m (10,800\u00a0ft) in the Rockies.[5][62] In the Andean Mountains,  on the other hand, they have adapted to being a true montane species, often found at least 3,300\u00a0m (10,800\u00a0ft) above sea level and are regularly recorded in treeless Puna grassland zones at 4,100 to 4,500\u00a0m (13,500 to 14,800\u00a0ft) in Ecuador and Peru.[63] They are generally rare in non-tidal wetland habitat,[64] and are replaced in the high Arctic tundra by snowy owls.[11] They prefer areas where open habitats, which they often hunt in, and woods, where they tend to roost and nest, are juxtaposed.[39][65][66] Thus lightly populated rural regions can be ideal. This species can occasionally be found in urban or suburban areas. However, they seem to prefer areas with less human activity and are most likely to be found in park-like settings in such developed areas, unlike eastern and western screech owls (Megascops asio & M. kennicottii) which may regularly occur in busy suburban settings. All mated great horned owls are permanent residents of their territories, but unmated and younger birds move freely in search of company and a territory, and leave regions with little food in winter.[11]"}, {"0": "In most aspects of their behavior, great horned owls are typical of owls and most birds of prey. From experimentally raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington felt that they were a bird of \"essentially low intelligence\" that could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt.[67] On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared behaviorally his captive-raised great horned owls to parrots, which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful \"it knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance\".[68] Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive.[6] Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for falconry or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington.[67][68] Carl D. Marti also disagrees with Errington's assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as \"completely random as Errington suggested\"; while \"Great Horned Owls appeared to select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations...cottontails, appeared to be selected as prey out of relation to their population status.\"[28]"}, {"0": "Like most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. Pine and other coniferous trees may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years.[3] While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the \"tall-thin\" position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position.[69] Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn.[42] Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas they may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female.[11] Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Since owls are, next to red-tailed hawks, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids.[70]"}, {"0": "Typically, great horned owls are highly sedentary, often capable of utilizing a single territory throughout their mature lives.[71] Although some species such as snowy owls, northern saw-whet owls, long-eared and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around.[5] In great horned owls, mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range from an average of 16\u00a0km2 (6.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Yukon to an average of 2.1\u00a0km2 (0.81\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Wyoming.[22][42]"}, {"0": "Most territorial defense is performed by males, but females frequently assist their partners in hooting contests with neighbors or intruders, even during incubation.[14] On occasion, although territory borders may be successfully maintained via vocalizations alone without even seeing the competing owl, such confrontations may turn physical, with various levels of threats distinguished. The highest threat level involves the spreading of wings, bill-clapping, hissing, higher-pitched screams of longer duration, with general body poised to strike with its feet at intruder. If the intruder continues to press the confrontation, the defending owl will \"hop\" forward and strike it with feet, attempting to grasp and rake with claws.[14]"}, {"0": "Territoriality appears to place a limit on the number of breeding pairs in a given area. Individuals prevented from establishing a territory live a silent existence as \"floaters\". Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories. At Kluane Lake in Yukon, incursions into neighboring territories were observed only twice\u2014by females when a neighboring female had died or emigrated, suggesting that territorial defense may be sex-specific. At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts.[42] Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression.[72] Northern populations occasionally irrupt south during times of food shortage,[73] but there is no annual migration even at the northern limits of the great horned owl's range.[42]"}, {"0": "Hunting tends to peak between 8:30 pm and midnight and then can resume from 4:30 am to sunrise.[74] Hunting tends to be most prolonged during winter by virtue of prey being more scarce.[75]  However, great horned owls can learn to target certain prey during daylight in the afternoon when it is more vulnerable, such as eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) while they're building their leaf nests and chuckawallas (Sauromalus ater) sunning themselves on desert rocks.[76][77] Owls hunt mainly by watching from a snag, pole or other high perch. During hunting forays, they often fly about 50 to 100\u00a0m (160 to 330\u00a0ft) from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey.[11] Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is 90\u00a0m (300\u00a0ft).[40] Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability.[26] Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing,[78] they also sometimes hunt by flying low over openings on the ground, scanning below for prey activity.[11] Great horned owls can fly at speeds of more than 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) in level flight.[5] Hunting flights are slow, often quartering low above the ground where prey is likely to occur in open country or open woodland. Brief hovering flight (for about 6\u201318 seconds) has been described, especially in windy areas.[79] On occasion owls may actually walk on the ground in pursuit of small prey or, rarely, inside a chicken coop to prey on the fowl within.[21] Rodents and invertebrates may be caught on foot around the base of bushes, through grassy areas, and near culverts and other human structures in range and farm habitat.[14] The great horned owl is generally a poor walker on the ground; it walks like a starling, with a pronounced side-to-side gait. They have been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported.[14] Owls can snatch birds and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.[4][11][21]"}, {"0": "Almost all prey are killed by crushing with the owl's feet or by incidentally stabbing of the talons, though some may be bitten about the face as well. Prey is swallowed whole when possible. When prey is swallowed whole, owls regurgitate pellets of bone and other non-digestible bits about 6 to 10 hours later, usually in the same location where the prey was consumed.[11] Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, 7.6 to 10.2\u00a0cm (3.0 to 4.0\u00a0in) long and 3.8\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to 3\u00a0cm (1.2\u00a0in) in width inside them.[21] However, not all prey can be swallowed at once, and owls will also fly with prey to a perch and tear off pieces with their bill. Most dietary studies focus on pellets found under perches and around nests, since they provide a more complete picture of the diversity of prey consumed, but prey remains outside of pellets may provide clues to prey excluded from the pellets and a combination of both is recommended.[5][80][81] Many large prey items are dismembered. Great horned owls may behead large prey before taking it to its nest or eating perch. The legs may also be removed, as may (in some bird prey) the wings. The great horned owl will also crush the bones of its prey to make it more compact for carrying.[82] On occasion, the owls may return to the kill site to continue eating if the prey is too heavy to fly with after dismemberment.[6] Many owls will accrue a cache of prey, especially those who are nesting. Caches must be at a safe location, usually the crotch of a tall tree. In northern regions, where large prey is prevalent, an owl may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using its own body heat.[18]  Hunting success seems to require fairly open understory, and experimental testing of microhabitat proved that open areas provided more hunting success on five species of rodent, with cloudy nights and denser bush foliage both decreasing success.[83]"}, {"0": "Prey can vary greatly based on opportunity. According to one author, \"Almost any living creature that walks, crawls, flies, or swims, except the large mammals, is the great horned owl's legitimate prey\".[29] In fact, the great horned owl has the most diverse prey profile of any raptor in the Americas.[5] Over 500 species have been identified as great horned owl prey, with dozens more identified only to genus or general type (especially numerous invertebrates) and presumably several more unknown from their relatively little-studied populations in the Neotropics. Mammals (more than 200 species) and birds (nearly 300 species) make up the majority of their diet.[5][80] Their diet in North America is made up of 87.6% mammals, 6.1% birds, 1.6% reptiles and amphibians with the remaining 4.7% being made up by insects, other assorted invertebrates and fish.[5] Estimated mass of individual prey for the owls has ranged from as little as 0.4\u00a0g (0.014\u00a0oz) to as much as 6.8\u00a0kg (15\u00a0lb)[84][85] Most prey is in the range of 4\u00a0g (0.14\u00a0oz) (shrews) to 2,300\u00a0g (5.1\u00a0lb) (jackrabbits).[84][86] A single owl requires about 50 to 100\u00a0g (1.8 to 3.5\u00a0oz) of food per day and can subsist on a large kill over several days.[87] Despite the great diversity of prey taken by these predators, in most of the continental United States from the East to the Midwest as well as Canada and Alaska, great horned owls largely live off just a handful of prey species: three species of lagomorph: the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus); two species of New World mice: the white-footed mouse and the North American deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus & maniculatus); approximately three species of vole: the meadow, prairie and woodland voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus, ochrogaster & pinetorum); and one introduced pest, the brown rat.[14][80][84]"}, {"0": "Small rodents form the great majority of great horned owl prey by number. Weighing a mere 14 to 31.5\u00a0g (0.49 to 1.11\u00a0oz) and 20 to 58\u00a0g (0.71 to 2.05\u00a0oz) on average, the nine species of New World mice in Peromyscus and eight species voles in Microtus recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable.[22][80] By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, Peromyscus mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the snow.[22][5][80] In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest.[80]  Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.[18]"}, {"0": "In the Rockies, California, the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the diversity of this species' diet rises, in sync with the diversity of rodents. Especially important, from Colorado to Washington state is the northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), although assorted other pocket gophers (Geomys, Cratogeomys, Zygogeomys, Pappogeomys and other Thomomys ssp.) are readily taken. While the northern weighs from 90 to 120\u00a0g (3.2 to 4.2\u00a0oz), other pocket gophers hunted average from 95 to 545\u00a0g (0.209 to 1.202\u00a0lb) in mass. From Washington to Baja California a very important food is the pocket mice, primarily the Great Basin pocket mouse (Perognathus parvus). While the Great Basin species is a relative giant at 22\u00a0g (0.78\u00a0oz), other hunted pocket mice (which may include both Perognathus and Chaetodipus ssp.) can average nearly as light as 8\u00a0g (0.28\u00a0oz). In East Texas, the 159\u00a0g (5.6\u00a0oz) hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is the most commonly recorded prey species.[88] The same species constituted 75% by number of a small sampling in Oklahoma.[89] In semi-desert and other arid habitats, kangaroo rats become increasingly important prey, ten species have been reported in the diet but most prominently the Ord's  and Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii & merriami), both being widespread, numerous and relatively diminutive (at 42 and 48\u00a0g (1.5 and 1.7\u00a0oz)). Eight known larger species of kangaroo rats, including the giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) averaging at 152\u00a0g (5.4\u00a0oz), are also taken.[90][91][92]"}, {"0": "The squirrels, including ground squirrels, marmots (Marmota), prairie dogs (Cynomys), chipmunks and tree squirrels, are diurnal and so are largely unavailable to great horned owls as prey. Occasionally though, one will be caught from their leaf nest, nest hole or burrow entrance first thing in the morning or in the late afternoon and approximately 35 species have been successfully predated by these owls. In general larger sized than other rodent families, the species hunting range from the 62\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0oz) gray-collared chipmunk (Tamias cinereicollis) to the 5,775\u00a0g (12.732\u00a0lb) hoary marmot (Marmota caligata); thus, squirrels can be provide a very fulfilling meal.[6][14][93]  An even larger rodent is sometimes attacked as prey by great horned owls, the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), in which average adults range from 4,500 to 9,000\u00a0g (9.9 to 19.8\u00a0lb). This has been determined from owls who have porcupine quills imbedded in them, sometimes resulting in death.[6][94] On occasion, they are successful in killing porcupine, even adults as determined by the size of the quills left behind and prey remains at bloodied kill sites.[87][95][96] Other rodents recorded as secondary prey in North America include flying squirrels (Glaucomys ssp.), the golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli), red-backed voles & bog lemmings (Myodes & Synaptomys ssp.), the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), the northern pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori) and jumping mice (Zapus & Napaeozapus ssp.).[6][14]"}, {"0": "Although generally no match for rodents in sheer quantity of individuals, in terms of prey biomass, the most significant prey of North American great horned owls are hares and rabbits. About a dozen lagomorphs species are known to be hunted by the owl, from the relatively tiny 420\u00a0g (0.93\u00a0lb) pygmy rabbit to several hares weighing more than 2,000\u00a0g (4.4\u00a0lb). Two hare species, the black-tailed jackrabbit and snowshoe hare, are so important to the owls as a food source that the local owl populations sharply rise and fall in sync with the hares' cyclical population trends. With adult weights of 800 to 1,900\u00a0g (1.8 to 4.2\u00a0lb) in adult cottontails, 900 to 2,000\u00a0g (2.0 to 4.4\u00a0lb) in snowshoe hares and 1,400 to 2,700\u00a0g (3.1 to 6.0\u00a0lb) in black-tailed jackrabbits, these species are overall the largest regular prey for this species.[5] In Utah, where great horned owls are dependent on the jackrabbits, average brood size rose from 2 at jackrabbit population lows to 3.3 when the jackrabbits were at their peak. At the peak of population cycle, jackrabbits accounted for 90.2% and desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii) for another 8.7% of prey biomass.[74][97] In the short-grass prairie of Colorado, mountain cottontail (Sylvilagus nuttallii) and black-tailed jackrabbits predominated in October to December, making up 42.9% by number (and nearly all the biomass), thence dropping to 9.3% by number in April, while voles rose to 32.2% peak in May, down to a minimum of 10.2% by number in June.[5] Further north in Colorado, in the absence of jackrabbits, the mountain cottontails falls to third place by number (12.9%) behind the northern pocket gopher (36.5%) and prairie vole (24.7%) but still dominates the biomass, making up about half.[98] In central Utah, the lagomorphs (black-tailed jackrabbit/desert cottontail) and Ord's kangaroo rat each made up 39% of the food by number, respectively.[74] The mountain cottontail dominates the biomass of prey in the Sierran foothills of California, making up 61.1% of the biomass, although are numerically secondary to desert woodrat.[90] Remarkably, in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area of Idaho, individual rodents (1159 counted) were more than 10 times more numerous than lagomorphs (114 counted) by quantity and yet the jackrabbit and mountain cottontail still made up approximately half of the biomass.[99] The dependence on lagomorphs also extends into Mexico, as in Baja California about a quarter of identified prey was black-tailed jackrabbit and either desert or the larger Mexican cottontail (Sylvilagus cunicularius).[100] In the northern boreal forest, great horned owls are even more dependent on the snowshoe hare. At the peak of the 10 year hare cycle, snowshoe hares were by far the largest component of both summer and winter diets (77\u201381% and 90\u201399%, respectively, in Alberta; 83\u201386% and 75\u201398%, respectively, in Yukon). At the lowest point of the hare's cycle, summer diets consisted of only 0\u201316% snowshoe hare in Alberta and 12.7% in Yukon. When hares were scarce, great horned owls in these regions fed mostly on large rodents, mice and voles, grouse and ducks. Because fewer of these alternative prey species are available in boreal forest during winter, owls had to emigrate or suffer high mortalities if they stayed.[101][102] In Alberta, the local population of great horned owls can increase threefold from hare population lows to peaks.[103] The dependency on the snowshoe hare by the great horned owl extends into Alaska as well.[104]"}, {"0": "Other mammals are taken readily as well. From both the tropics and the United States, several species of opossum may be taken, down to the size of the tiny dwarf fat-tailed mouse opossum (Thylamys velutinus). In Brazil, white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris) were found in 12% of pellets, but all specimens appeared to be juveniles each weighing about 1,000\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0lb).[105] Quite differently, in Pennsylvania, Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginianus) made up 6% by number of prey but due to their large size (approximately 2,500\u00a0g (5.5\u00a0lb)) and that all specimens were adults, they occupied the highest percentage of biomass of any species in a wide study from that state.[106] At least eight species of shrews are taken by opportunity and make up the smallest mammalian prey taken by great horned owls, as specimens of least shrew (Cryptotis parva) or masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) have had an estimated weight of only 2\u00a0g (0.071\u00a0oz).[84] One of the more regularly taken shrews, though, is the larger 19.5\u00a0g (0.69\u00a0oz) northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda), which was represented in more than 2% of pellets in the Upper Midwest.[80] Moles, of at least four or five species, are also widely but lightly reported as prey.[80][84] Remnants of armadillo, presumably nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), have been found around owl nests in the south.[6] 11 species of bat are known to be hunted by great horned owls.[5][107][108][109] One pellet in Texas was found to be composed entirely of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis).[110] Smaller species of mammalian carnivore, such as ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), American mink (Neogale vison), black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) and various other small mustelids (Mustela ssp.), are sometimes taken as prey.[6][14][111][112] Prey in the form of canids, like foxes or coyotes (Canis latrans) are often juveniles presumably snatched from the mouths of dens by night.[6][14][113][114][115] Kit and swift foxes of up to adult size may taken.[87][116][117] Surprisingly, at least two cases of a great horned owl preying on an adult raccoon (Procyon lotor) have been reported.[118][119] One instance of an owl taking a bobcat (Lynx rufus) as prey was also reportedly observed.[87] In one case, a great horned owl was the likely killer of an adult female fisher (Martes pennanti), though young ones are typically taken.[120][121] Occasionally, domestic carnivores are also prey. A few cases of young or small dogs (Canis lupus familiaris)[122][123] and several of juvenile and adult cats (Felis silvestris catus)[124][125][126] being killed by great horned owls have been reported.[6][115] The most infamous predatory association amongst relatively larger carnivores is that with skunks. Due to their poor sense of smell, great horned owls are the only predators to routinely attack these bold mammals with impunity. All six skunk species found in North America are reported as prey, including adult striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), which can be three times as heavy as the attacking owl.[6][84][127] In one single nest, the remains of 57 striped skunks were found.[128] Due to the proclivity of skunk predation, great horned owls nests frequently smell strongly of skunk and occasionally stink so powerfully of skunk that they leave the smell at kill sites or on prey remains.[14][129]"}, {"0": "After mammals, birds rank as the next most important general prey group. Birds are usually considerably secondary in the diet but outnumber the mammals in the diet by diversity, as more than 250 species have been killed in North America alone. Statistically, the most significant avian prey seems to be galliforms, of which they are known to have preyed on 23 species, basically consisting of all of the native species found in the United States.[6][14] In the Upper Midwest, the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) were the fifth and sixth (out of 124 identified species) most significant prey species in 4838 pellets.[80] Errington characterized the predatory pressure exerted on bobwhites by great horned owls as \"light but continuous pressure\", which may be considered characteristic of the species' hunting of all galliforms.[130] Usually coveys of quail are partially protected by spending the night roosting communally in dense thickets but should a hunting owl be able to track down the communal roost, losses can be fairly heavy until the roost relocates.[22] Similarly, owls may track down sleeping grouse, which also roost in vegetation but more openly than quail. Some grouse, such as greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) and greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus),  may also been vulnerable to great horned owls while displaying conspicuously in openings on a lek first thing in the morning.[131] In the boreal forest, especially in years where the snowshoe hare experiences population decreases, great horned owls prey fairly heavily (approximately 25% of biomass) on ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), enough so in the earlier bird to possibly contribute to population reductions.[101][132] Larger species of galliform are not immune to predation either. On Protection Island in Washington state, introduced common peafowl (Pavo cristatus) are an important prey item.[133] The wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), 4 to 8\u00a0kg (8.8 to 17.6\u00a0lb) on average between the sexes, is probably the largest bird the great horned owl hunts in which they kill adults. Both full-grown wild turkeys[134] and adult domestic turkeys[6] have been hunted and killed. Under normal circumstances, domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) will be ignored in favor of wild prey. On occasion, individual owls, especially inexperienced juveniles, will become habitual fowl killers. These errant owls mainly hunt chickens, though will also take domestic guineafowl, turkeys and anything else available.[80] In general, chickens kept in locked cages with enclosed tops overnight are safe from great horned owls; not so chickens left free range or in open enclosures.[6]"}, {"0": "While galliforms are widely reported, the few cases where great horned owls locally turn to birds as the primary food source over mammals, these may often be local responses to the abundance of breeding water birds or concentrations of roosting water birds, since they tend to roost in relatively open spots. They have been known to predate more than 110 different species of assorted water bird.[5] In prairie wetlands of North Dakota, avian prey, primarily represented by ducks and the American coot (Fulica americana) came to represent 65% by number and 83% by biomass of the diet of the local owls, also including secondarily grebes, smaller rails and shorebirds as well as upland-based species like grey partridge (Perdix perdix), sharp-tailed grouse and passerines. 77% of the ducks in that study were juveniles, the largest duck being a male mallard (Anas platyrhnychos) weighing approximately 1,250\u00a0g (2.76\u00a0lb), but nearly all the coots were adults.[85] On Protection Island, Washington, where they are no native land mammals, rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), both adults and nestlings, were the most numerous prey, present in 93% of 120 pellets.[133] Species as large as adult Canada geese, snow goose[6][80] and great blue herons[14] have been successfully killed. The nestlings of even larger species like trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator),[135] American white pelicans (Pelecanus eryhtrorhynchos),[136] brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis)[137] and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis)[138] have also been killed by these owls."}, {"0": "Other assorted birds are taken seemingly at random opportunity. The predatory effect of this species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In Brazil, it was found in a small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference.[105] Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of passerine have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as chickadees, warblers, sparrows, cardinals, wrens and most tyrant flycatchers only a few species from each have been recorded. Nonetheless, an occasionally unlucky migrant or local breeder is sometimes snatched.[5][6][80] Fledgling songbirds are regularly taken in spring and summer.[87] The smallest avian prey known for great horned owls are the 5.8\u00a0g (0.20\u00a0oz) blue-grey gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) and the 6.2\u00a0g (0.22\u00a0oz) ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula).[80] Somewhat larger bodied families are more prominent, i.e. the corvids (14 species) and icterids (14 species) and, secondarily, the kingbirds (Tyrannus ssp.), thrushes, mimids and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris).[5][6][80] This is likely due to the fact that the larger passerines usually roost in relatively open spots and have larger, more conspicuous nests. Crows and ravens tend to be grabbed off of their communal roosts by night.[14]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl rarely misses an opportunity to hunt reptiles and amphibians. However, lizards are largely unavailable as prey due to their typically diurnal periods of activity.[14] However, some snakes are partially or largely nocturnal, and more than a dozen species are hunted in North America. Snakes hunted range from small, innocuous garter snakes (Thamnophis ssp.) and night snakes (Hypsiglena torquata) to venomous species like cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) and prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus virdis) and formidable, large species like common king snakes (Lampropeltis getula) and black rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus), which in mature specimens can rival the owl in mass and sheer predatory power.[6] The capture of the hatchlings of very large reptiles such as loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) by great horned owls has been reported, in both cases likely when the baby reptiles are attempting to make their way to the security of water.[6][139] On rare occasion, salamanders, frogs and toads are reported as prey.  On rare occasions, fish are taken including goldfish (Carassius auratus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), bullheads (Ameiurus ssp.), other catfish, suckers, sunfish, eels and dace and chub.[6][87] Many types of invertebrates are recorded as prey. These include mainly insects, but also crayfish, crabs, spiders, scorpions and worms. The occasionally invertebrate prey taken largely consists of common, large insects such as various beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, water bugs and katydids, some of which the great horned owl has even reportedly caught via \"hawking\", i.e. swooping at on the wing.[6][14][140] In some cases, the content of insects in great horned owl pellets may actually be due to the owls eating other birds which have freshly eaten insects in their own stomachs.[80] It is commonly believed that routine insectivory in great horned owls is mainly restricted to inexperienced young owls too unskilled to graduate to larger prey yet. It is clearly inefficient for owls of this size to attempt to raise young on a diet of foods as small as insects.[28] Although rare, carrion-feeding has been recorded in great horned owls, especially ones wintering in Canada and other northern areas during harsh weather.[141] Road kills are sometimes opportunistically eaten. A case of an owl scavenging a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) carcass, ultimately tearing off the deer's leg, was captured on a motion capture video camera set out to film wildlife.[142]"}, {"0": "Studies comparing the diets of rural and urban great horned owls have identified that the most abundant rodent prey in their environment fulfils the majority of their diet.[143][144][145][146] A study of food niche overlap between closely nested barn and great horned owls living in rural north-eastern Oregon identified voles as by far the most common prey.[144] In southwestern British Columbia, Townsend's voles were the most common prey species, while consumption of rats increased as the nesting location became more urban and rats replaced voles as the most abundant and stable food source.[143]  A similar focus on rats was found in populations in urban parks in Seattle.[147]  Although a stable and highly abundant food source, a diet consisting of primarily rats can be harmful to urban great horned owls due to bioaccumulation of rodenticides.[148]"}, {"0": "Due to their very broad dietary habits, the great horned owls share their prey with many other predators, including avian, mammalian and reptilian ones. Almost every study comparing the diets of North American owls illustrates the considerable overlap in the dietary selection of these species, as all species, besides the primarily insectivorous varieties, rely on many of the same small rodent species for most of their diet, extending from the small northern saw-whet owl and eastern screech owl to the great horned and great grey owls.[28][84]"}, {"0": "In a long-term study of a block of Michigan, all nine species of accipitrid, falcon and owl that stayed to breed there were found to be primarily dependent on the same two rodent genera, the meadow vole and the two common Peromyscus species.[22] In the Great Basin, the owls share black-tailed jackrabbit and desert cottontail as the primary prey with golden eagles, red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis); all four species had diets with more than 90% of the biomass is made up of those lagomorphs. Of these, the great horned owl and golden eagle were able to nest most closely to one another because they had the most strongly dissimilar periods of activity.[61][97] In California, when compared to the local red-tailed hawks and western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox), the diets were most similar in that by number about 15-20% of all three species' diets depended on cottontails, but the largest portion was made up of ground squirrels in the hawk and the rattlesnake and desert woodrats and other assorted rodents in the great horned owl.[90] In the boreal forests, the great horned owl's prolificacy as a snowshoe hare hunter places it second only to the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) among all predators. Although locally dependent on the hares as their main food, northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-tailed hawks and golden eagles apparently do not have as large of an impact on the hares, nor do mammalian carnivore generalists that also kill many hares, like the fisher, bobcat, wolverine (Gulo gulo), coyote and larger varieties (i.e. wolves (Canis lupus), cougars (Puma concolor) and bears (Ursus ssp.)).[42][73][103][149]"}, {"0": "The relationship between great horned owls and other raptorial birds in its range is usually decidedly one-sided. While certain species, such as the red-tailed hawk and northern goshawk, might be seen as potential competition for the owls, most others seem to be regarded merely as prey by great horned owls. The great horned owl is both the most prolific and diverse predator in America of other birds of prey, with other accomplished raptor-hunters such as the goshawk and the golden eagle being more restricted in range, habitat and number in North America and thus having a more minor impact. All studies have found raptors are a small portion of this owl's diet but predation can be seriously detrimental for such prey, as raptors tend to be territorial and sparsely distributed as a rule and thus can be effectively decimated by a small number of losses.[5][84] In the gray hawk (Buteo plagiatus), for example, in a study of one breeding block of Arizona, the owls were observed to visit nests nightly until all the nestlings were gone.[150]"}, {"0": "Raptorial birds in general tend to have large, conspicuous nests which may make them easier for a hunting owl to locate. The great horned owl gains an advantage by nesting earlier than any other raptor in its range (indeed any bird), as it is able to exploit the other raptors as food while in a more vulnerable state as their own nestlings have become well developed.[22] On average, great horned owls begin nesting about three weeks before red-tailed hawks begin to build nests, although some raptors may locally breed as much as two months after the owls.[14][151]"}, {"0": "More so than diurnal varieties of raptor, fairly significant numbers of owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of Wisconsin, great horned owls were responsible for the failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests.[22] Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves.[25][78][152] In a pair of studies from Colorado, the average weight of prey for long-eared owls was 28 to 30\u00a0g (0.99 to 1.06\u00a0oz), 46 to 57.1\u00a0g (1.62 to 2.01\u00a0oz) for barn owl and 177 to 220\u00a0g (6.2 to 7.8\u00a0oz) for the great horned owl.[28][98]"}, {"0": "Both young and adult great grey owls, despite their superficially superior size, are apparently hunted with impunity by great horned owls. In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations.[153][154] Great horned owls were the leading cause of mortality in juvenile spotted owls (30% of losses) and juvenile great grey owls (65% of losses).[153][155] Less is known about relations with the snowy owl, which may compete with great horned owls for food while invading south for the winter. Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.[12]"}, {"0": "Whereas owls of any age are freely attacked by great horned owls whether nesting or not, when it comes to diurnal raptors, great horned owls are mainly a danger around the nest. They often hunt diurnal raptors when they come across their often relatively conspicuous active platform nests during hunting forays in spring and summer, taking numbers of both nestlings and brooding adults.[14] Again, like owls, diurnal raptors are attacked depending on the relative similarity of their habitat preferences to the owl. Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) and red-tailed hawks tend to be most vulnerable, as they prefer the same wooded edges frequented by great horned owls. Other diurnal raptors may be attracted to more enclosed wooded areas, such as sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) or zone-tailed hawks (Buteo albonotatus), or more open plain and meadow areas, such as Northern harriers (Circus hudsonius) and ferruginous hawks, but this is almost never a total insurance against predation as all of these are recorded prey.[80][156][157][158]"}, {"0": "In a study of red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) and broad-winged hawk (Buteo brachyurus) breeding in New York, despite their nesting in deeper woods than those that host these owls, the main cause of nest failure was great horned owl predation.[129] Similarly, the great horned owl was the primary cause of nesting failure for both desert-dwelling Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) and forest-dwelling northern goshawk in Arizona (39% and 40% of failures, respectively), wetland-inhabiting osprey (Pandion haliaetus) in Delaware (21% of failures) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) in the Western United States (27% of failures).[159][160][161][162] The fact that many of the nests great horned owls use are constructed by accipitrids may lead to localized conflicts, almost always to the detriment of the hawks rather than the owls. While the young of larger diurnal raptors are typically stolen in the night, great horned owls also readily kill large adult raptors both in and out of breeding seasons, including osprey, northern goshawk and rough-legged buzzard.[163][164][165]"}, {"0": "Great horned owls are frequently mobbed by other birds. Most accipitrids will readily mob them, as will falcons. Hen harriers, northern goshawks, Cooper's hawks, Harris's hawks, red-tailed hawks, Swainson's hawks, ferruginous hawks, red-shouldered hawks, American kestrels, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons (Falco mexicanus) and common ravens (Corvus corax) are among the reported species who have been recorded diving on great horned owls when they discover them.[14][81][166][167] In Arizona and Texas, they may be mobbed by Mexican jays and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma wollweberi & californica) and western and Cassin's kingbirds (Tyrannus verticalis & vociferans).[168][169] In addition, there are several documented incidences of American crows mobbing a great horned owl, in groups of dozens or even hundreds of crows.[6] In response to mobbing, if the owl flies it alights to the nearest secluded spot. If an owl alights on ground or on exposed branch or ledge, it may respond to swooping and stooping flights of corvids and raptors with threat display and raising of its wings.[14]"}, {"0": "Great horned owls are some of the earliest-breeding birds in North America, seemingly in part because of the lengthy nightfall at this time of year and additionally the competitive advantage it gives the owl over other raptors. In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January.[11] This species was once thought to be strictly monogamous, but recent analysis indicates one male may mate with two females simultaneously, as was discovered for the first time in 2018 in Reno, Nevada.[170] During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball.[11] The white throat may serve as a visual stimulus in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts.[42] He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share.[6][11] While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days.[41] Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent.[11] Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.[41]"}, {"0": "Males select nesting sites and bring the females' attention to them by flying to the nest and then stomping on it.[11] Considering the owls' large size, nests with open access are preferred to those enclosed with surrounding branches. Like all owls, great horned owls do not build their own nest. Great horned owls tend to examine an area for an abandoned nest, generally from larger birds like hawks, and take over the nest for raising their own young.[171] They nest in a wider variety of sites than any other North American bird.[41] Many nests are in cavernous hollows of dead trees or their branches, and especially in southern states in large trees along the edge of old-growth lots.[41] In mountainous or hilly areas, especially in canyons of the Southwest and Rocky Mountains, cliff ledges, small caves, and other sheltered depressions may be used.[41] Owls living in prairie country, in the absence of other animals' nests, riparian tree-hollows or man-made structures, will use boulders, buttes, railroad cuts, low bushes and even the bare ground as nest sites.[41] Ground nests have also been recorded in the midst of tall grasses in Florida and in the midst of brushy spots on desert ground.[5] Even the burrow entrances of American badger and coyote dens have reportedly been used as nests, in spite of the inherent risk of sharing space with such potentially dangerous co-inhabitants.[41] Nesting behavior for the great horned owl appears to be more closely related to prey availability than it does to seasonal conditions. There has been some evidence that if prey availability is low enough then the species may forgo mating entirely for a season. Male and female owls of the species have been observed to help incubate the eggs once they have been laid on a nest.[172]"}, {"0": "Most tree nests used by great horned owls are constructed by other animals, often from a height of about 4.5 to 22\u00a0m (15 to 72\u00a0ft) off the ground. They often take over a nest used by some other large bird, sometimes adding feathers to line the nest but usually not much more. Allegedly there have some cases where the owls have reinforced a nest structure or appeared to have reconstructed a nest, but as a rule no owl species has ever been known to actually build a nest.[41] Great horned owls in the Southwest may also use nests in cacti, built by Harris's hawk and red-tailed hawk, as well as large hollows in cacti.[173] The nests they use are often made by most larger types of acciptrids, from species as small as Cooper's hawks to bald eagle and golden eagle, though perhaps most often those of red-tailed hawks and other buteonines. Secondly in popularity are crow and raven (Corvus ssp.) nests. Even Canada goose, black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and great blue heron nests have been used, the latter sometimes right in the midst of an active heronry.[174][175] The leaf nests of squirrels are also regularly used but in general great horned owls are partial to stick nests since they provide a much firmer, safer foundation.[14]"}, {"0": "The stage at which eggs are laid is variable across North America. In Southern Florida, eggs may be laid as early as late November to as late as early January. In the southeast, from south Texas to Georgia, egg laying may begin from late December to early February. From Southern California to northern Louisiana, egg laying is from early February to late March. The largest swath of egg-laying owls from central California to South Carolina to as far north as Ohio and Massachusetts is from late February to early April. In the Rocky Mountains, Northwestern United States, northern New England and eastern Canada, egg laying is from early March to late April. In the rest of Canada and Alaska, egg laying may be from late March to early May.[41] The latest known date of egg laying was in mid-June in Saskatchewan and the Yukon Territory.[176] In northwestern Utah and north-central Alberta, egg-laying can be 3\u20134 weeks earlier than usual when food is abundant and weather is favorable.[14] For owls found in more tropical climates, the dates of the breeding season are somewhat undefined.[11] There are usually 2 eggs per clutch, but clutches range in size from 1 to 6 eggs (over 3 is uncommon, over 4 is very rare), depending on environmental conditions.[177][178] The average egg width is 46.5\u00a0mm (1.83\u00a0in), the average length is 55\u00a0mm (2.2\u00a0in) and the average weight is 51\u00a0g (1.8\u00a0oz), although mass could be slightly higher elsewhere because this figure is from Los Angeles County, CA where the owls are relatively small.[179] The incubation period ranges from 28 to 37 days, averaging 33 days.[180] The female alone usually does all the incubation and rarely moves from the nest, while the male owl captures food and brings it to her, with the first nightly food delivery typically occurring soon after dark.[14]"}, {"0": "The young weigh 34.7\u00a0g (1.22\u00a0oz) at birth on average and can gain about 33\u00a0g (1.2\u00a0oz) a day for the first four weeks of life, with typical weights in the range of 800 or 1,000\u00a0g (1.8 or 2.2\u00a0lb) by 25\u201329 days for males and females, respectively.[179][180] When first hatched the young are covered in whitish gray down, with some brownish about the wings. Gradually the soft juvenal downy plumage comes through the down, being typically a cinnamon-buff color, but with variable hues predicting the eventual color of the mature owls. The extent of down gradually diminishes, developing mature-looking plumage by late summer, although many first year birds still have scattered bits of down into autumn. By late autumn, first-year birds look similar to adults but with a slightly warmer, reddish tinge, less well developed ear tufts and a smaller white throat patch.[6] The nestling owls develop mostly in behavior between two weeks and two months of age, in which time they adapt the ability to defend themselves, grasp foods and climb. Vocally, the young are able to exert weak chips while still in the egg, developing into a raspy chirp shortly after hatching. The calls of the young increase rapidly in intensity, pitch and character, some juvenile males mimicking their father's hooting in fall but usually they conclude with various odd gurgling notes. The earliest competent hooting by juvenile owls is not until January.[14][181] Young owls move onto nearby branches at 6 weeks and start to fly about a week later. However, the young are not usually competent fliers until they are about 10 to 12 weeks old.[11] The age at which the young leave the nest is variable based on the abundance of food.[103]"}, {"0": "The young birds stay in an area ranging from 13 to 52 ha from the nest into fall, but will usually disperse up to several thousand hectares by the end of fall.[182][183] The offspring have been seen still begging for food in late October (5 months after leaving the nest) and most do not fully leave their parents territory until right before the parents start to reproduce for the next clutch (usually December to January).[184] Birds may not breed for another year or two, and are often vagrants (\"floaters\") until they establish their own territories.[42] Based on the development of the bursa, great horned owls reach sexual maturity at two years of age.[185]"}, {"0": "While urban and rural populations show little difference in productivity, there are differences in nest selection.[186][187]  Rural owls use old raptor nests more frequently than urban birds, who utilize crow or squirrel nests. Additionally, urban nesting individuals utilize trees that are taller/wider in diameter and nest much higher compared to rural nesting Great Horned Owls. The reason behind this increased tree height is due to the fact that urban areas have large trees used for ornamentation, shade and shelter. The higher nesting within the taller trees was attributed to human avoidance. Both rural and urban nesting sites were often within range of paved roads, likely a result of the great horned owl\u2019s tendency to hunt along roadways[186]"}, {"0": "Studies have shown that nesting in urban areas can influence adult great horned owls to lay eggs earlier than those who nest in rural areas. In Wisconsin, eggs in urban nests hatched a month earlier (January rather than February) than their counterparts in rural areas, probably due to increased protection from wind and cold.[188] Nesting owls at sites in Winnipeg, Manitoba began nesting five to six weeks earlier than those in rural parts of Manitoba, presumably due to experiencing an extremely warm winter by Winnipeg\u2019s standards, as well as benefitting from the local urban heat island.[189]"}, {"0": "Great horned owls seem to be the most long-living owl in North America. Among all owls, they may outrank even the larger Eurasian eagle owl in known longevity records from the wild,[5] with almost 29 years being the highest age for an owl recorded in North America.[190] In captivity, the record for the longest lived great horned owl was 50 years.[191] A more typical top lifespan of a great horned owl is approximately 13 years.[18] In general, great horned owls are most vulnerable in the early stages of life, although few species press attacks on the owl's nests due to the ferocious defensive abilities of the parents. Occasionally, nestlings and fledglings will fall from the nest too early to escape or to competently defend themselves and fall prey to foxes, bobcat, coyotes, or wild or feral cats. Occasionally raccoons and American black bears consume eggs and nestlings from tree nests and Virginia opossum may take the rare unguarded egg.[5][14] Crows and ravens have been reported eating eggs and small nestlings. This can normally only happen when owls are driven from the nest by human activity or are forced to leave the nest to forage by low food resources but on occasion huge flocks of crows have been able to displace owls by harassing them endlessly.[6][14] In general, great horned owls rarely engage in siblicide, unlike many other raptorial birds. Siblicide occurred at 9 of 2,711 nests in Saskatchewan.[73] Most cases where young owls are killed and/or consumed by their siblings or parents appear to occur when the nestling is diseased, impaired or starving or is inadvertently crushed.[80] Adults generally have no natural predators, excepting both North American eagles and other owls of their own species.[6]"}, {"0": "Occasionally, great horned owls may be killed by their own prey. Although typically able to kill skunks without ill effect, five owls were found blind after getting sprayed in their eyes by skunks.[192] Cases where the quills of porcupines have killed or functionally disabled them have been observed as well.[94] Violent fights have been observed between great horned owls after attempts to capture rat snakes and black racers.[6][193][194] When a peregrine falcon repeatedly attacked a great horned owl near its nest along the Hudson River, it was apparently unable to dispatch the larger raptor despite several powerful strikes.[195] During their initial dispersal in fall, juvenile owls have a high mortality rate, frequently more than 50%.[14] For owls in the Yukon Territory, juvenile survival in the 9 weeks after dispersal has dropped from 80% to 23.2% in a span of three years in response of instability of food supply. In the Yukon, adults on territory had an average annual survival rate of 90.5%.[42] Anemia, caused by Leucocytozoon ziemanni and the drinking of blood by swarming, blood-drinking blackflies (Simulium ssp.), was a leading cause of juvenile mortality in the Yukon.[65]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl is not considered a globally threatened species by the IUCN.[1] Including the Magellanic species, there are approximately 5.3 million wild horned owls in the Americas.[18] Most mortality in modern times is human-related, caused by owls flying into man-made objects, including buildings, cars, power lines, or barbed wire.[14] In one study, the leading cause of death for owls was collision with cars, entanglement with wires, flying into buildings and, lastly, electrocution.[196] Among 209 banded nestlings in yet another study, 67% were found dead after independence: 56 were found shot, 41 were trapped, 15 hit by cars, 14 found dead on highways and 14 electrocuted by overhead power lines.[197] Secondary poisoning from pest control efforts is widely reported variously due to anticoagulant rodenticides, strychnine, organophosphates (famphur applied topically to cattle (Bos primigenius taurus)), organochlorines, and PCBs.[198][199][200][201][202][203]"}, {"0": "Frequently, the species were denominated a pest due to the perceived threat it posed to domestic fowl and potentially small game. The first genuine nature conservationists, while campaigning against the \"Extermination Being Waged Against the Hawks and Owls\", continued to advocate the destruction of great horned owls due to their predatory effect on other wildlife.[5] Thus, small bounties were offered in trade for owl bodies. Around the turn of the 20th century, the great horned owl was considered endangered in the state of Michigan because of the large number of poachers who were illegally hunting and collecting it.[204] Hunting and trapping of great horned owls may continue on a small scale but is now illegal in most countries."}, {"0": "Occasionally, these owls may prey on threatened species. Following the devastation to its populations from DDT, the reintroduction of the peregrine falcon to the Mississippi and Hudson Rivers was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night.[205] Similarly, as mainly recorded in New England, attempts to reintroduce ospreys, after they were also hit hard by DDT, were affected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of roseate terns.[14] Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the Pacific Northwest, spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation.[39][206] While at least the ospreys and peregrines have rebounded admirably nonetheless, bird and mammal species that are much rarer overall sometimes fall prey to great horned owls, many in which even sporadic losses can be devastating. Among the species considered threatened, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN which are also known to be killed by great horned owls are Townsend's ground squirrels (Urocitellus townsendii),[99] Pacific pocket mice (Perognathus pacificus),[207] giant kangaroo rats,[208] Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi),[209] black-footed ferrets,[210] greater and lesser prairie chickens,[211][212] marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus),[213] ivory-billed woodpeckers, Florida scrub jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens),[214] pinyon jays,[215] Kirtland's warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii)[216] and rusty blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus).[130] The American Bird Conservancy's \"green list\" includes birds with considerable population declines (many classed as near threatened by the IUCN) or other immediate threats and/or restricted populations. Altogether, great horned owls hunt 50 different species from that list.[5][217]"}, {"0": "Many warrior-based tribes of Native Americans admired the great horned owl for their \"strength, courage and beauty\".[87] The Pima of the Southwest believed that owls were reincarnations of slain warriors who fly about by night. The Arikara of the Great Plains had mystic owl societies in which initiates were made to adorn a facial mask made of the wing and tail feathers of great horned owls. Some Indian nations regarded the great horned owl as a friendly spirit that could aid in matters of love, such as the Passamaquoddy of Maine, who felt the call of this species was a magical love flute designed to ignite human passions. The Hopi of the Southwest also associated this owl with fertility, albeit of a different kind: they believed the calling of the owls into summer predicted hot weather, which produced good peach crops. During the winter solstice, the Hopi performed a ceremony with great horned owl feathers in hopes of summoning the heat of summer. Tribes in New Mexico were known to use owl wing-feathers to produce arrows which could strike their enemies with a minimum of sound. The Zuni held owl feathers in their mouths hoping to gain some of the silence that owls use in ambushes while striking their own enemies from other tribes. The Iroquois felt the origin of the great horned owl was due to an unformed owl annoying Raweno, the almighty creator, while Raweno created the rabbit, causing Raweno to make the owl \"covered with mud\" (dark camouflage) and doomed to ceaselessly call \"whoo whoo\", which he used while harassing Raweno by night because Raweno was active during the day.[87]"}, {"0": "The great horned owl is the provincial bird of Alberta.[218]"}, {"0": "Haemophila pulchra (protonym)"}, {"0": "The great Inca finch (Incaspiza pulchra) is a species of passerine bird in the tanager family Thraupidae.

Short songs, however, are primarily used in territorial encounters with rival males.[15]"}, {"0": "During experimental observation, male great reed warblers showed reluctance to approach recordings of short songs, and when lured in by long songs, would retreat when playback was switched to short songs.[15]"}, {"0": "Traditionally, monogamous species of genus Acrocephalus use long, variable, and complex songs to attract mates, whereas polygynous varieties use short, simple, stereotypical songs for territorial defence. There is evidence that long songs have been evolved through intersexual selection, whereas short songs have been evolved through intrasexual selection.

Some pairs of warblers are monogamous, but others are not, and unpaired, so-called \"satellite\" males still father some young.[17] Great reed warblers defend their nests using graded alarm calls, directed towards a wide range of enemies,[18] although these alarm calls might reveal the whereabouts of the nest to brood parasites.[19]"}, {"0": "A long-term study of the factors that contribute to male fitness examined the characteristics of males and territories in relation to annual and lifetime breeding success. It showed that the arrival order of the male was the most significant factor for predicting pairing success, fledgling success, and number of offspring that survive. It also found that arrival order was closely correlated with territory attractiveness rank. Females seem to prefer early arriving males that occupy more attractive territories. These females also tend to gain direct benefits through the increased production of fledglings and offspring that become adults. In addition, male song repertoire length is positively correlated to annual harem size and overall lifetime production of offspring that survive. Song repertoire size alone is able to predict male lifetime number of surviving offspring. Females tend to be attracted to males with longer song repertoires since they tend to sire offspring with improved viability. In doing so, they gain indirect benefits for their own young.[20][21]"}, {"0": "Great reed warblers have a short, polygynous breeding cycle in which the male contributes little to parental care. They defend large territories in reed beds where there is reduced visibility, which may allow males to practice deception by moving and attracting a second female. This second female may not realize that the male has already mated. Polygyny of the great reed warbler was assessed in another study that showed the importance of female choice. The differences in territory characteristics seemed to be more important. However, there is also a strong correlation between males and their territory characteristics. Models based on the polygyny threshold and sexy son hypotheses predict that females should gain evolutionary advantage in either short-term or long-term in this mating system, yet the study did not support this. The data showed that secondary females had greatly reduced breeding success.[22][23]"}, {"0": "The great rosefinch (Carpodacus rubicilla) is a species of finch in the family Fringillidae.

Ants seem to be generally favored in the diet, though larvae of other species may be eaten quite regularly as well. Occasionally, small fruit may supplement the diet. Females spend more time searching for feeding sources and males, which have slightly larger bills, spend more time opening the sources. Preferred feeding sources are mostly found in large branches or trunks of large, living trees. The groups will travel considerable distance to access these trees and, as such, the home ranges of the species are quite large. Occasionally, though, they will feed at lower levels in trees and even amongst saplings. Usually, feeding groups of these woodpeckers do not linger in any given area for long. Sometimes this species associates with slightly smaller white-bellied woodpeckers and considerably smaller greater flamebacks, with the foraging methods of the very different woodpeckers minimizing competition between the species. Perhaps more considerable competition for food sources generally comes in the form of hornbills and arboreal (or tree-dwelling) mammals. The great slaty woodpecker usually works a tree upwards and, though capable of swifter movements, has been described while foraging as if moving in \"slow motion\". It forages by gleaning, probing, pecking, prising off bark and hammering with powerful and loud blows to excavate the wood. Gleaning is the most important foraging method for the species, with the long neck and bill allowing it to reach out over a considerable distance into the cracks and crevices of trees. This species often flies high over the trees for long distances between successful foraging patches. In flight, its feather rustle noisily.

Few nests of the species have been described in detail, but at least occasionally nests are raised cooperatively by groups.[5] Known nests, at anywhere from 9 to 45\u00a0m (30 to 148\u00a0ft) in height in the trees, were located in very large trees. When excavating the nest hole, both parents participate but reportedly the male does the majority of the work. The nest hole entrance will be around 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) across, but much wider inside the tree. The pair will only use a nest from a prior year if competition is too overbearing for a newly constructed hole. The nesting season, in Malaysia at least, appears to be from March to August. The clutch reportedly consists of two to four eggs, which are incubated by both parents. Both parents also feed and generally brood the young. The young great slaty woodpeckers probably stay with their parents until the next breeding season.[2]"}, {"0": "Probably because of their feeding and breeding dependence on large old trees, great slaty woodpeckers are most common in primary forests and show density reductions of over 80% in logged forests.[6] The global population is in decline because of the loss of forest cover and logging of old-growth forest throughout its range, with habitat loss being particularly rapid in Myanmar, Cambodia and Indonesia which are the countries that still hold the majority of the global population.

Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about two to three times during peak activity.[27] The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass.[18] The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body.[27] Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much.

P. m. mallorcae is like the nominate subspecies, but has a larger bill, greyer-blue upperparts and slightly paler underparts. P. m. ecki is like P. m. mallorcae except with bluer upperparts and paler underparts. P. m. excelsus is similar to the nominate race but has much brighter green upperparts, bright yellow underparts and no (or very little) white on the tail. P. m. aphrodite has darker, more olive-grey upperparts, and the underparts are more yellow to pale cream. P. m. niethammeri is similar to P. m. aphrodite but the upperparts are duller and less green, and the underparts are pale yellow. P. m. terrasanctae resembles the previous two subspecies but has slightly paler upperparts. P. m. blandfordi is like the nominate but with a greyer mantle and scapulars and pale yellow underparts, and P. m. karelini is intermediate between the nominate and P. m. blandfordi, and lacks white on the tail. The plumage of P. m. bokharensis is much greyer, pale creamy white to washed out grey underparts, a larger white cheep patch, a grey tail, wings, back and nape. It is also slightly smaller, with a smaller bill but longer tail. The situation is similar for the two related subspecies in the Turkestan tit group. P. m. turkestanicus is like P. m. bokharensis but with a larger bill and darker upperparts. P. m. ferghanensis is like P. m. bokharensis but with a smaller bill, darker grey on the flanks and a more yellow wash on the juvenile birds.[10]"}, {"0": "The colour of the male bird's breast has been shown to correlate with stronger sperm, and is one way that the male demonstrates his reproductive superiority to females. Higher levels of carotenoid increase the intensity of the yellow of the breast its colour, and also enable the sperm to better withstand the onslaught of free radicals.[16] Carotenoids cannot be synthesized by the bird and have to be obtained from food, so a bright colour in a male demonstrates his ability to obtain good nutrition.[17] However, the saturation of the yellow colour is also influenced by environmental factors, such as weather conditions.[18] The width of the male's ventral stripe, which varies with individual, is selected for by females, with higher quality females apparently selecting males with wider stripes.[15]"}, {"0": "The great tit is, like other tits, a vocal bird, and has up to 40 types of calls and songs. The calls are generally the same between the sexes, but the male is much more vocal and the female rarely calls. Soft single notes such as \"pit\", \"spick\", or \"chit\" are used as contact calls. A loud \"tink\" is used by adult males as an alarm or in territorial disputes. One of the most familiar is a \"teacher, teacher\", often likened to a squeaky wheelbarrow wheel, which is used in proclaiming ownership of a territory.[10] In former times, English folk considered the \"saw-sharpening\" call to be a foretelling of rain.[19] There is little geographic variation in calls, but tits from the two south Asian groups recently split from the great tit do not recognise or react to the calls of the temperate great tits.[10]"}, {"0": "One explanation for the great tit's wide repertoire is the Beau Geste hypothesis. The eponymous hero of the novel propped dead soldiers against the battlements to give the impression that his fort was better defended than was really the case. Similarly, the multiplicity of calls gives the impression that the tit's territory is more densely occupied than it actually is. Whether the theory is correct or not, those birds with large vocabularies are socially dominant and breed more successfully.[20]"}, {"0": "The great tit has a wide distribution across much of Eurasia. It can be found across all of Europe except for Iceland and northern Scandinavia, including numerous Mediterranean islands. In North Africa it lives in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. It also occurs across the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia from northern Iran and Afghanistan to Mongolia, as well as across northern Asia from the Urals as far east as northern China and the Amur Valley.[10]"}, {"0": "The great tit occupies a range of habitats. It is most commonly found in open deciduous woodland, mixed forests, forest edges and gardens. In dense forests, including conifer forests it prefers forest clearings. In northern Siberia it lives in boreal taiga. In North Africa it rather resides in oak forests as well as stands of Atlas cedar and even palm groves. In the east of its range in Siberia, Mongolia and China it favours riverine willow and birch forest. Riverine woodlands of willows, poplars are among the habitats of the Turkestan subspecies, as well as low scrubland, oases; at higher altitudes it occupies habitats ranging from dense deciduous and coniferous forests to open areas with scattered trees.[10]"}, {"0": "The great tit is generally not migratory. Pairs will usually remain near or in their territory year round, even in the northern parts of their range. Young birds will disperse from their parents' territory, but usually not far. Populations may become irruptive in poor or harsh winters, meaning that groups of up to a thousand birds may unpredictably move from northern Europe to the Baltic and also to Netherlands, Britain, even as far as the southern Balkans.[21]"}, {"0": "The great tit was unsuccessfully introduced into the United States; birds were set free near Cincinnati, Ohio between 1872 and 1874 but failed to become established. Suggestions that they were an excellent control measure for codling moths nearly led to their introduction to some new areas particularly in the United States of America, however this plan was not implemented.[22] A small population is present in the upper Midwest, believed to be the descendants of birds liberated in Chicago in 2002 along with European goldfinches, Eurasian jays, common chaffinches, European greenfinches, saffron finches, blue tits and Eurasian linnets, although sightings of some of these species pre-date the supposed introduction date.[23] Birds were introduced to the Almaty Province in what is now Kazakhstan in 1960\u201361 and became established, although their present status is unclear.[24]"}, {"0": "Great tits are primarily insectivorous in the summer, feeding on insects and spiders which they capture by foliage gleaning.[25] Their larger invertebrate prey include cockroaches, grasshoppers and crickets, lacewings, earwigs, bugs (Hemiptera), ants, flies (Diptera), caddis flies, beetles, scorpion flies, harvestmen, bees and wasps, snails and woodlice.[10] During the breeding season, the tits prefer to feed protein-rich caterpillars to their young.[26] A study published in 2007 found that great tits helped to reduce caterpillar damage in apple orchards by as much as 50%.[27] Nestlings also undergo a period in their early development where they are fed a number of spiders, possibly for nutritional reasons.[26] In autumn and winter, when insect prey becomes scarcer, great tits add berries and seeds to their diet. Seeds and fruit usually come from deciduous trees and shrubs, like for instance the seeds of beech and hazel. Where it is available they will readily take table scraps, peanuts and sunflower seeds from bird tables. In particularly severe winters they may consume 44% of their body weight in sunflower seeds.[10] They often forage on the ground, particularly in years with high beech mast production.[25] Great tits, along with other tits, will join winter mixed-species foraging flocks.[12]"}, {"0": "Large food items, such as large seeds or prey, are dealt with by \"hold-hammering\", where the item is held with one or both feet and then struck with the bill until it is ready to eat. Using this method, a great tit can get into a hazelnut in about twenty minutes. When feeding young, adults will hammer off the heads of large insects to make them easier to consume, and remove the gut from caterpillars so that the tannins in the gut will not retard the chick's growth.[10]"}, {"0": "Great tits combine dietary versatility with a considerable amount of intelligence and the ability to solve problems with insight learning, that is to solve a problem through insight rather than trial and error.[10] In England, great tits learned to break the foil caps of milk bottles delivered at the doorstep of homes to obtain the cream at the top.[28] This behaviour, first noted in 1921, spread rapidly in the next two decades.[29] In 2009, great tits were reported killing, and eating the brains of roosting pipistrelle bats. This is the first time a songbird has been recorded preying on bats. The tits only do this during winter when the bats are hibernating and other food is scarce.[30] They have also been recorded using tools, using a conifer needle in the bill to extract larvae from a hole in a tree.[10]"}, {"0": "Great tits are monogamous breeders and establish breeding territories.[31] These territories are established in late January and defence begins in late winter or early spring.[10] Territories are usually reoccupied in successive years, even if one of the pair dies, so long as the brood is raised successfully. Females are likely to disperse to new territories if their nest is predated the previous year. If the pair divorces for some reason then the birds will disperse, with females travelling further than males to establish new territories.[32] Although the great tit is socially monogamous, extra-pair copulations are frequent. One study in Germany found that 40% of nests contained some offspring fathered by parents other than the breeding male and that 8.5% of all chicks were the result of cuckoldry.[33] Adult males tend to have a higher reproductive success compared to sub-adults.[34]"}, {"0": "Great tits are seasonal breeders. The exact timing of breeding varies by a number of factors, most importantly location. Most breeding occurs between January and September; in Europe the breeding season usually begins after March. In Israel there are exceptional records of breeding during the months of October to December. The amount of sunlight and daytime temperatures will also affect breeding timing.[10] One study found a strong correlation between the timing of laying and the peak abundance of caterpillar prey, which is in turn correlated to temperature.[35] On an individual level, younger females tend to start laying later than older females.[36]"}, {"0": "Great tits are cavity nesters, breeding in a hole that is usually inside a tree, although occasionally in a wall or rock face, and they will readily take to nest boxes. The nest inside the cavity is built by the female, and is made of plant fibres, grasses, moss, hair, wool and feathers. The number in the clutch is often very large, as many as 18, but five to twelve is more common. Clutch size is smaller when birds start laying later, and is also lower when the density of competitors is higher.[37] Second broods tend to have smaller clutches. Insularity also affects clutch size, with great tits on offshore islands laying smaller clutches with larger eggs than mainland birds.[38] The eggs are white with red spots. The female undertakes all incubation duties, and is fed by the male during incubation.[10] The bird is a close sitter, hissing when disturbed. The timing of hatching, which is best synchronised with peak availability of prey, can be manipulated when environmental conditions change after the laying of the first egg by delaying the beginning of incubation, laying more eggs or pausing during incubation.[39] The incubation period is between 12 and 15 days.[10]"}, {"0": "The chicks, like those of all tits, hatch unfeathered and blind. Once feathers begin to erupt, the nestlings are unusual for altricial birds in having plumage coloured with carotenoids similar to their parents (in most species it is dun-coloured to avoid predation). The nape is yellow and attracts the attention of the parents by its ultraviolet reflectance. This may be to make them easier to find in low light, or be a signal of fitness to win the parents' attention. This patch turns white after the first moult at age two months, and diminishes in size as the bird grows.[40]"}, {"0": "Chicks are fed by both parents, usually receiving 6\u00a0to 7\u00a0g (0.21\u20130.25\u00a0oz) of food a day.[10] Both parents provision the chicks with food and aid in nest sanitation by removing faecal packets, with no difference in the feeding effort between the sexes.[41] The nestling period is between 16 and 22 days, with chicks being independent of the parents eight days after fledging. Feeding of the fledgeling may continue after independence, lasting up to 25 days in chicks from the first brood, but as long as 50 days in the second brood.[10] Nestlings from second broods have weaker immune systems and body condition than those from first broods, and hence have a lower juvenile survival rate.[42]"}, {"0": "Inbreeding depression occurs when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness.  The reduced fitness is generally considered to be a consequence of the increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles in these offspring.  In natural populations of P. major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.[43]"}, {"0": "The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a predator of great tits, with the young from second broods being at higher risk partly because of the hawk's greater need for food for its own developing young.[44][45] The nests of great tits are raided by great spotted woodpeckers, particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes.[46] Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels (in Britain) and least weasels, which are able to take nesting adults as well.[47] A species of biting louse (Mallophaga) described as Rostrinirmus hudeci was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe.[48] The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits. It was originally a specialist tit flea, but the dry, crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host.[49] This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle Gnathoncus punctulatus,[49] The rove beetle Microglotta pulla also feeds on fleas and their larvae. Although these beetles often remain in deserted nests, they can only breed in the elevated temperatures produced by brooding birds, tits being the preferred hosts.[49] Great tits compete with the pied flycatcher for nesting boxes, and can kill prospecting flycatcher males. Incidences of fatal competition are more frequent when nesting times overlap, and climate change has led to greater synchrony of nesting between the two species and flycatcher deaths. Having killed the flycatchers, the great tits may consume their brains.[50]"}, {"0": "Great tits have been found to possess special physiological adaptations for cold environments. When preparing for winter months, the great tit can increase how thermogenic (heat producing) its blood is.[51] The mechanism for this adaptation is a seasonal increase in mitochondrial volume and mitochondrial respiration in red blood cells and increased uncoupling of the electron transport from ATP production.[51] As a result, the energy that would have been used to make ATP is released as heat and their blood becomes more thermogenic.[51] In the face of winter food shortages, the great tit has also shown a type of peripheral vasoconstriction (constriction of blood vessels) to reduce heat loss and cold injury.[52] Reduced cold injury and heat loss is mediated by the great tits\u2019 counter-current vascular arrangements, and peripheral vasoconstriction in major vessels in and around the birds\u2019 bill and legs.[52] This mechanism allows uninsulated regions (i.e., bill and legs) to remain close to the surrounding temperature. In response to food restriction, the great tits\u2019 bill temperature dropped, and once food availably was increased, bill temperatures gradually returned to normal.[52] Vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the bill not only serves as an energy saving mechanism, but also reduces the amount of heat transferred from core body tissues to the skin (via cutaneous vasodilation), which, in turn, reduces heat loss rate by lowering skin temperature relative to the environment.[52]"}, {"0": "The great tit is a popular garden bird due to its acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts or seed. Its willingness to move into nest boxes has made it a valuable study subject in ornithology; it has been particularly useful as a model for the study of the evolution of various life-history traits, particularly clutch size.[53] A study of a literature database search found 1,349 articles relating to Parus major for the period between 1969 and 2002.[6]"}, {"0": "The great tit has generally adjusted to human modifications of the environment. It is more common and has better breeding success in areas with undisturbed forest cover, but it has adapted to human modified habitats. It can be very common in urban areas.[10] For example, the breeding population in the city of Sheffield (a city of half a million people) has been estimated at some 17,000 individuals.[54] In adapting to human environments its song has been observed to change in noise-polluted urban environments. In areas with low frequency background noise pollution, the song has a higher frequency than in quieter areas.[55] This tit has expanded its range, moving northwards into Scandinavia and Scotland, and south into Israel and Egypt.[10] The total population is estimated at between 300\u20131,100 million birds in a range of 32.4\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (12.5\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). While there have been some localised declines in population in areas with poorer quality habitats, its large range and high numbers mean that the great tit is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.[1]"}, {"0": "The great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) also known as the eastern white pelican, rosy pelican or white pelican is a bird in the pelican family.

In South Africa, the average weight of males was 9.6\u00a0kg (21\u00a0lb) and of females was 6.9\u00a0kg (15\u00a0lb). Thus the sexual dimorphism is especially pronounced in this species (perhaps the greatest known in any extant pelican), as at times the male can average more than 30% more massive than the female. The great white pelican rivals the kori bustard, which has even more pronounced sexual dimorphism, as the heaviest flying bird to reside in Africa (both averaging perhaps slightly heavier than the cape vulture and the wattled crane). There are a small few slightly heavier flying birds in the Eurasian portions of the range.[9][10] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 60 to 73\u00a0cm (24 to 29\u00a0in), the tail 16 to 21\u00a0cm (6.3 to 8.3\u00a0in), and the tarsus 13 to 14.9\u00a0cm (5.1 to 5.9\u00a0in) long.

More than 50% of Eurasian great white pelicans breed in the Danube Delta in Romania. They also prefer staying in the Lakes near Burgas, Bulgaria and in Srebarna Lake in Bulgaria. The pelicans arrive in the Danube in late March or early April and depart after breeding from September to late November.[3] Wintering locations for European pelicans are not exactly known but wintering birds may occur in northeastern Africa through Iraq to north India, with a particularly large number of breeders from Asia wintering around Pakistan and Sri Lanka.[3] Northern populations migrate to China, India, Myanmar, with stragglers reaching Java and Bali in Indonesia.[5] These are birds that are found mostly in lowlands, though in East Africa and Nepal may be found living at elevations of up to 1,372\u00a0m (4,501\u00a0ft).[3]"}, {"0": "Overall, the great white pelican is one of the most widely distributed species.

Well scattered groups of breeding pelicans occur through Eurasia from the eastern Mediterranean to Vietnam.[3] In Eurasia, fresh or brackish waters may be inhabited and the pelicans may be found in lakes, deltas, lagoons and marshes, usually with dense reed beds nearby for nesting purposes.[3] Additionally, sedentary populations are found year-round in Africa, south of the Sahara Desert although these are patchy. In Africa, great white pelicans occur mainly around freshwater and alkaline lakes and may also be found in coastal, estuarine areas.[20] Beyond reed beds, African pelicans have nested on inselbergs and flat inshore islands off of Banc d'Arguin National Park.[3]"}, {"0": "The great white pelican is highly sociable and often forms large flocks.[15] It is well adapted for aquatic life.

As the pelican pushes its bill underwater, the lower bill bows out, creating a large pouch which fills with water and fish. As it lifts its head, the pouch contracts, forcing out the water but retaining the fish. A group of 6 to 8 great white pelicans gather in a horseshoe formation in water to feed together. They dip their bills in unison, creating a circle of open pouches, ready to trap every fish in the area. Most feeding is cooperative and done in groups, especially in shallow waters where fish schools can be corralled easily, though they may also forage alone as well.[3]"}, {"0": "Great white pelicans are not restricted to fish, however, and are often opportunistic foragers. In some situations, they eat chicks of other birds, such as the well documented case off the southwest coast of South Africa.[21] Here, breeding pelicans from the Dassen Island prey on chicks weighing up to 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0lb) from the Cape gannet colony on Malgas Island.[22] Similarly, in Walvis Bay, Namibia the eggs and chicks of Cape cormorants are fed regularly to young pelicans.

Their pouch is used to make tobacco bags, their skin is turned into leather, the guano is used as fertiliser, and the fat of its young is converted into oils for traditional medicine in China and India. In Ethiopia, great white pelicans are shot for their meat. Human disturbance, loss of foraging habitat and breeding sites, as well as pollution are all contributing to the decline of the great white pelican.

However, their breeding areas were largely unknown for a long time until a very large nesting colony was finally discovered in 1877 at Shwaygheen on the Sittaung River, Pegu, Burma. It was believed that the Indian birds bred there.[27][28] This breeding colony, which also included spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis), declined in size and entirely vanished by the 1930s.[29] Subsequently, a nest site in Kaziranga was the only known breeding area until new sites were discovered in Assam, the Tonle Sap lake and in the Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary. In 1989, the breeding population in Assam was estimated at 115 birds,[29][30][31][32] and between 1994 and 1996 the population in the Brahmaputra valley was considered to be about 600.[33][34] A small colony with about 35 nests was discovered near Bhagalpur in 2006.

The nest is a large platform of twigs placed at the end of a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree.[27] Nests are rarely placed in forks near the center of a tree, allowing the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees.[45] The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs,[27] is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate[46] and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months.[47] The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old.

Since nesting in this area follows the summer monsoonal flooding, it is presumably a response to fish stocks rising, probably due to river run-off providing extra nutrient to the Gulf.[25] This tern does not show site fidelity, frequently changing its nest site from year to year,[16] sometimes by more than 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi).[19]"}, {"0": "A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting, and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.[26]"}, {"0": "The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping ground.

Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large prawn trawl fishery.[33] Conversely, purse-seine fishing reduces the available food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of great crested terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by purse-seine fishing.[32] Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked by longline fishing, but, unlike albatrosses and petrels, there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected.[14]"}, {"0": "An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off Robben Island, South Africa by marine foam, generated by a combination of wave action, kelp mucilage and phytoplankton.

The Hadza people of northern Tanzania frequently burn, bury, or hide the wax that lays with the intent of keeping the bird hungry, and more likely to guide again.[3] Some greater honeyguides have stopped this guiding behavior, or mutualism, in parts of Kenya, due to a loss of response from people in the area.[7][8]"}, {"0": "Many sources[9][10][11] say that this species also guides honey badgers.

They begin calling from as early as 4 am in moonlight often with a metallic tunk-tunk-tunk series.[16] They have an ability to accurately mimic alarm calls of other birds that are learnt through interactions in mixed-species flocks. This is quite unusual, as avian vocal mimicry has hitherto been believed to be ignorant of the original context of the imitated vocalization. Grey parrots are known to use imitated human speech in correct context, but do not show this behavior in nature.[17] This drongo's context-sensitive use of other species' alarm calls is thus analogous to a human learning useful short phrases and exclamations in a number of foreign languages. A special alarm note is raised in the presence of shikras that has been transcribed as a loud kwei-kwei-kwei...shee-cuckoo-sheecuckoo-sheecuckoo-why!.[16] They have been said to imitate raptor calls so as to alarm other birds and steal prey from them in the ensuing panic.[18][19] They are also known to imitate the calls of species (and possibly even behaviour as it was once recorded to fluff up and moving head and body like a jungle babbler when imitating its calls) that typically are members of mixed-species flocks such as babblers[20] and it has been suggested that this has a role in the formation of mixed-species flocks.[21] In some places they have been found to be kleptoparasitic on others in mixed-species flock, particularly laughingthrushes but they are most often involved in mutualistic and commensal relations.[22][23][24] Several observers have found this drongo associating with foraging woodpeckers[25][26][27] and there is a report of one following a troop of macaques.[28]"}, {"0": "The greater racket-tailed drongo is a resident breeder throughout its range.

The drake or male greater scaup is larger and has a more rounded head than the female. The drake's belly and flanks are a bright white. Its neck, breast, and tail feathers are a glossy black, while its lower flanks are vermiculated gray. The upper wing has a white stripe starting as the speculum and extending along the flight feathers to the wingtip. Legs and feet of both sexes are gray.

They typically nest on islands in large northern lakes. Greater scaup begin breeding when they are two years old, although they may start nesting at age one. Drake greater scaup have a soft, quick whistle they use to attract the attention of hens during courtship, which takes place from late winter to early spring, on the way back to their northern breeding grounds. Female greater scaup have a single pitch, a raspy \u201carrr-arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr\u201d vocalization.[22] The courtship is complex and results in the formation of monogamous pairs.[23] Pairs nest in close proximity to each other in large colonies, usually near water, on an island or shoreline, or on a raft of floating vegetation. The nest consists of a shallow depression made by the female and lined with her down.[14] After the female lays the eggs, the drake abandons the female[23] and goes with other drakes to a large, isolated lake to molt. These lakes can be close to the breeding grounds or miles away. The lakes chosen are used yearly by the same ducks. The optimal molting lake is fairly shallow and has an abundance of food sources and cover.[24] The female lays six to nine olive-buff-colored eggs,[25] which she incubates for 24\u201328 days.[26] A larger clutch could indicate brood parasitism by other greater scaups or even ducks of other species.[27] Newly hatched chicks are covered with down and are soon able to walk, swim, and feed themselves; however, they are not able to fly until 40\u201345 days after hatching.[18][23] The vulnerable small chicks follow their mother, who protects them from predators.[23]"}, {"0": "The greater scaup dive to obtain food, which they eat on the surface.[14] They mainly eat molluscs, aquatic plants, and aquatic insects.[22] During the summer months, the greater scaup will eat small aquatic crustaceans.[14] There is a report of four greater scaups in April near Chicago swallowing hibernating leopard frogs (a species with a body length about 5 centimetres, or 2.0 in), which they dredged out of a roadside freshwater pond.[28] In freshwater ecosystems, the greater scaup will eat seeds, leaves, stems and roots, along with sedges, pondweeds, muskgrass, and wild celery.[15] Owing to the greater scaup's webbed feet and weight, it can dive up to 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) and stay submerged for up to a minute, allowing it to reach food sources that are unobtainable to other diving ducks.[29]"}, {"0": "Common predators of the greater scaup are owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans.[30] Greater scaup often find themselves entangled in fishing nets, thus large numbers of them drown in nets each year.

It was estimated that the greater scaup made up about 11% of the continental scaup population. Since the 1980s, scaup populations have been steadily decreasing. Some of the primary factors contributing to this decline are habitat loss, contaminants, changes in breeding habitat, and a lower female survival rate. The 2010 American scaup population survey was 4.2\u00a0million scaup,[33] however, the worldwide greater scaup population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature greater scaup.[17] Along with the aerial population surveys, there is a banding program for the greater scaup. Metal leg bands are placed on them, so that if the scaup is killed by a hunter or if it is captured by another banding group, the number on the band can be reported to biologists and wildlife organizations.

Below juvenile greater spotted eagles have largely black (apart from the creamy crissum) wing linings contrasting with paler greyer-soot flight feathers. Other juvenile plumages are variably paler but with quills as those of a typical juvenile.[4] The birds that breed in the Ural-Volga area are slightly larger and more muted in plumage characteristics and slightly smaller sizes in the species seem to be prevalent farther west, i.e. Europe; there appears to be a near 5% size difference in favor of Indian wintering birds over Middle East ones.[27]"}, {"0": "The greater spotted eagle is a medium-sized eagle and a large raptor.[7] Despite their similar plumages, this species shows strong sexual dimorphism in favour of the female. The size difference is up to 26% linearly and females not uncommonly can be as much as twice as heavy as the males, making them rival the martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus) as perhaps the most sexual dimorphic member of the Aquilinae on average.[4][7] However, on the contrary, some of the largest male greater spotted eagles can overlap in most linear and mass measurements with smaller females.[24][28] Total length of full-grown greater spotted eagles can vary from 59 to 74\u00a0cm (23 to 29\u00a0in).[29][30] In wingspan, males have been reported to measure 155 to 177\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in to 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) while females can measure from 167 to 185\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in to 6\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in).[29][31][32] One sample of males averaged 166.4\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) and of females averaged 174.7\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in).[7] Body mass for males has been reported as ranging from 1,537 to 2,000\u00a0g (3.389 to 4.409\u00a0lb).[7][33] A sample of 3 males was found to average 1,733\u00a0g (3.821\u00a0lb), a sample of 8 males to average 1,689\u00a0g (3.724\u00a0lb), a sample of 4 to average 1,743\u00a0g (3.843\u00a0lb) while an unknown sample size averaged 1,702\u00a0g (3.752\u00a0lb).[7][34][28] Females have been found to range in body mass from 1,820 to 3,250\u00a0g (4.01 to 7.17\u00a0lb).[34][28] Four females were found to average 2,678\u00a0g (5.904\u00a0lb), 8 to average 2,419\u00a0g (5.333\u00a0lb), another 8 to average 2,264\u00a0g (4.991\u00a0lb) and an unknown sample size averaged 2,586\u00a0g (5.701\u00a0lb).[7][34][28] Among standard measurements, wing chord can range from 477 to 519\u00a0mm (18.8 to 20.4\u00a0in) in males and from 507 to 545\u00a0mm (20.0 to 21.5\u00a0in) in females.[4][33] In two samples males averaged 503 and 503.4\u00a0mm (19.80 and 19.82\u00a0in) in wing chord while females averaged 521.4 and 529\u00a0mm (20.53 and 20.83\u00a0in).[7][35] The shortish tail varies from 227 to 249\u00a0mm (8.9 to 9.8\u00a0in) in males and from 235 to 268\u00a0mm (9.3 to 10.6\u00a0in) in females.[4] The fairly long tarsus is from 97 to 105\u00a0mm (3.8 to 4.1\u00a0in) in males and from 96 to 112\u00a0mm (3.8 to 4.4\u00a0in) in females.[4][36] Reportedly, the culmen length can range from 32.5 to 39\u00a0mm (1.28 to 1.54\u00a0in).[37]"}, {"0": "The greater spotted eagle is quite noisy when breeding and is often very vocal too in winter, especially when in small loose flocks.[4] The commonest call is often heard during inner or intra species conflicts and is a soft, one-syllable, penetrating, high-pitched, urgent whistle variously transcribed as kyack, kluh, tyuck or dyip. The call is not unlike that of lesser spotted eagles but is slightly deeper and more ringing. However, their calls are higher pitched than steppe eagles and much higher pitched than those of the eastern imperial eagles, the latter having a guttural call somewhat reminiscent of a big frog.[4][7] Additionally, a not dissimilar agonistic three-syllable bark is seemingly used to warn off intruders at a feeding site, sometimes considered a harsh chrr-chrr-chaa-chaa, kyak-yak-yak and kyew-kyew-kyew. The cumulative effect of the repeated call is not unlike that of a \"small hound\" it is said.[7][33][38] As with many raptors, the female\u2019s tone is lower pitched and hoarser.[7] One individual greater spotted eagle recorded over two days was found to utter an unusual ringing call that sounded remarkably similar to the first two syllables of the typical call of the crested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela).[5]"}, {"0": "Despite a fairly unique appearance, field identification of greater spotted eagle can be quite difficult.[39] Primarily this species is told from lesser spotted eagles by structure and proportions, though distant birds may be practically indistinguishable.[4][23] The adult compared to the lesser appears very broad winged, which in turn makes the head look relatively small though it is important to remember that greater spotted juveniles can appear less bulky looking, narrower and more rounded along the wing and longer-tailed making their proportions closer to the lesser.[4][23] Size can be clearly larger in the greater spotted eagle, with female greater spotted eagles effectively dwarfing most lesser spotted but there is a very broad size overlap between the two spotted eagle species, and in some cases male greater spotteds can be scarcely larger than even male lesser spotted eagles.[4][5] Side-by-side, it is fairly conspicuous how much darker a pure greater spotted eagle typically is than a lesser spotted eagles.[29][23] Greater spotted eagles, when compared to the lesser spotted eagles, are notable for their lack of nape patch, dark uppertail coverts, blackish-brown uniform arms, or uniform, dark upperwing coverts (not contrastingly rusty brownish).[23] Some intermediates are difficult to tell from young lesser spotted eagles, but can be told by the greater spotted eagles intermediate\u2019s usually darker wing linings, morphology, differences in appearance of primary patch and carpal arc.[4] The juvenile usually lacks pale nape patch of the lesser spotted eagle, but it is sometimes present \"albeit only slightly paler than rest of plumage and never ochre or orange\".[40] Typically the spotting and barring pattern is much stronger in juvenile greater than in lesser spotted eagles but this is not always reliable.[23] Causing higher difficulty, the hybrids of the two spotted eagles often are often muddled and varied in appearance, some hybrids being much closer to one species or the other.[23] Pure greater spotted eagles can be told from pure lesser spotted eagles via in hand measurements such as bill height, width and extent of white spots on the juvenile and the length of middle toe.[41][42] The greater spotted eagle in the Indian subcontinent might be confused with Indian spotted eagles, more so greater spotteds in faded plumage.[5] The Indian species is smaller (of a size or slighter even than the lesser spotted eagle), somewhat narrower-winged and longer-tailed than the present species, with primary fingers more deeply cut and square ended. The Indian species has a more distinct pale window in primaries, paler and less distinctly streaked underparts, and paler upperparts (more like a steppe eagle in colour) with less distinct, more diffuse pale tips to the larger wing-coverts. Furthermore, the Indian spotted eagle has a notably deeper gape extending behind its eye.[5][29]"}, {"0": "From non-spotted eagles of similar or of larger sizes, the greater spotted eagle tends to be fairly compact in features with proportionately broad (and short-looking) wings, a shortish tailed and an overall darker and distinct patterned plumage.[5] One rather similar eagle is the steppe eagle which is larger and bulkier than the greater spotted eagle. Compared to the steppe eagle, the greater spotted eagle has a shorter neck, smaller bill with a shorter gape line, no pale nape patch (seen in adult steppe), narrower and less baggy trousers, and generally much shorter, slightly broader wings. At a distance they can look quite alike, but in favourable light you may look for the steppe eagle's bolder, more extensively barring on the greyer flight feathers, complete lack of carpal arcs below, paler throat and above paler nape and larger but more diffuse primary patch.[4][29] Greater spotted eagles of the fulvescens and intermediate morphs resemble a large number of eagles, are separated by underwing colour and pattern such as their distinct carpal arc and thinly dark barred quills, from pale or intermediate morph of the similarly sized tawny eagle (Aquila rapax), which is usually less dark backed without the defused dark face and possessing more typical, less broad wing proportions. Juveniles of the eastern imperial eagle can resemble fulvescens greater spotted eagles but are larger and clearly structurally different. The imperial has much longer and narrower wings, a longer neck, a bigger, more prominent beak with an oblong (rather than oval) nail, a longer and narrower gape line, more conspicuous pale inner inner primaries, no carpal arc, a brown-streaked breast (though greater spotteds can show some diffuse marks), unmarked tarsal feathering, pale irides and obvious pale window on inner primaries.[4][43] Against the paler morph greater spotted eagles, beyond structural dissimilarities, subadult steppe eagles can be told by the thicker well-spotted quill bars and paler underwing diagonal.[4] In the eastern portion of range, can be told apart from the even darker black eagle via that eagle being much slimmer with paddle-shaped wings and long and clearly barred tail.[4]"}, {"0": "This raptor is distributed primarily in the Palearctic and the Indomalayan regions.[4] Its breeding range in Central Europe and most of Southeastern Europe is highly restricted today to small pockets such as far eastern Poland with isolated pockets spilling over seldom into western Belarus as well as in far southwestern Ukraine, far southwestern Romania perhaps spilling over into northeastern Serbia and probably formerly in eastern Hungary.[1][19][44]  A more continuous breeding range begins in Eastern Europe including eastern Estonia, eastern Latvia, eastern Lithuania, Belarus from the central region broadly to the east and much of eastern Ukraine.[1] A questionable number of breeding birds spill over into far eastern Finland.[45] They are found quite broadly almost throughout European Russia where habitat is favorable up through much of Arkhangelsk Oblast to as far as the lower coasts of the White Sea. They are found across much of Central Russia, rarely far to the north, but can range to their probable northern limits as breeders in Shuryshkarsky and Pitkyarantsky. They are also found in a broad strip across southern Siberia reaching in Russia well into the Amur region.[1][33][46] Their range out of Russia includes much of northern Kazakhstan with isolated breeding areas known in the East Kazakhstan Region and in southern Kazakhstan. Greater spotted eagles will also breed in a broad but generally isolated area from Kyrgyzstan and adjacent areas of Russia down to as far Xinjiang in China.[1][46][47] Greater spotted eagles at times have been known to breed in the Indian subcontinent, reportedly Gujarat northwards to Punjab and even recorded breeding as far south as Saurashtra, (unsuccessfully) in Keoladeo National Park and as far as northern Maharashtra. However, this may have only been historically and almost certainly there is not a stable breeding population today.[5][48][49][50] They are also distributed as breeders in northern Mongolia, rather far Northeastern China and northern North Korea.[1]"}, {"0": "Greater spotted eagles may disperse widely during migration, usually by about October (or sometimes September) on through November as well as February to April in spring, being found more broadly in distribution than during breeding or wintering.[1][5][19] While migrating, greater spotted eagles may be seen in much of Eastern Europe, Anatolia and almost throughout the Middle East, Central Asia (from Kazakhstan south) and western South Asia.[1][19][51][52] This species is prone to vagrancy, which has been reported in several countries in Europe including the Netherlands, Great Britain, Gibraltar and the Czech Republic.[53][54][55][56] They are sometimes documented in central and east Afghanistan.[57] Its regular breeding range no longer extends as far westwards as Germany but birds are still occasionally seen there with a few records per decade. Even young birds disperse widely; the Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Tierkunde Dresden has a specimen (C 21845) shot in November 1914 near Bernsdorf in Saxony. It is a juvenile, and though its exact age cannot be determined it is heavily spotted and probably less than 20 months old.[58] Additionally, vagrancy has been reported in several nations of Africa including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Botswana.[19][59][60][61][62] They also may distribute in East Asia across the southern part of the Russian Far East, eastern China and discontinuously in Southeast Asia from Myanmar and Thailand down through the Malay Peninsula.[1][63] Occasionally, a greater spotted eagle may be documented even in Indonesia (i.e. Sumatra).[64]"}, {"0": "Dedicated wintering areas tend to be more limited and isolated than where the species is seen in migration.[1] The central wintering areas for the species are principally the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East and the Indomalayan realm.[5][65][66] Small pockets may exist in southwestern Spain and bordering Portugal, South France, northeastern Italy, western Greece (where sometimes even considered the most common wintering eagle), small areas of southern Bulgaria, eastern Romania and southern Moldova.[1][19][67][68][69][70] Other wintering areas including northeastern Egypt, southern Sudan and adjacent South Sudan, north-central Ethiopia, scattered areas of the Middle East including northern Israel, Kuwait and central Syria.[1][19][71][72] More continuously they are found through much of the southern coastal Arabian Peninsula, including broadly along the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia coast as well as west and southern Yemen, southern Oman, coastal United Arab Emirates and eastern Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, they winter in southeastern Turkey, Azerbaijan, southeastern Georgia, rather eastern Iraq, broadly in western, northern and eastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan, western Afghanistan and far western Pakistan.[1][73][74][75][76] They are also found discontinuously in eastern Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh, southern Bhutan into northwestern Myanmar. In India, the winter range is through Indo-Gangetic Plain to Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal to Assam (including the North Cachar hills) and northeastern hill states extending south through central India. They were once reasonably common in the Malabar and Carnatic coasts but likely only back over a hundred years ago.[5][14][77][78] After another gap, they are found in much of southern and central Myanmar, central and southern Thailand, southern Laos, the northern tip of Vietnam, discontinuously in southeastern Vietnam and much of Cambodia and southern coastal Malaysia.[1][79][80][81][82] In China wintering greater spotted eagles range from Jiangsu and Anhui continuously down to northern Guangdong across to Taiwan, as well as seldom in Korea.[1][83][84]"}, {"0": "The greater spotted eagle is found in open wet forests and forest edge, often adjoining marshy, swampy patches, bogs or wet meadows, as well as quite often river-valley woodland and floodplain forests.[4] They generally show rather greater attachment to wetlands than lesser spotted eagle, even where there is more human activity but can be found in drier hillside forest in Central Asia.[4] The differences in habitat preferences between the species was confirmed in northeastern Poland where the wooded areas nested in by the greater spotted eagles were in floodplains with considerably more annual flooding than those used by lesser spotted eagle.[85] Although typically scarce while breeding in areas modified by heavy human development, they have been seen to hunt over cultivated land in Estonia and also it is seen migrating over lowland farms typically in the Czech Republic.[4][56] Predominantly in Russia, it is found at the intersection points of taiga forest and open steppe often coincide around river valleys as well as pine forests, nearly dwarf forest, in wet, wooded areas of the steppe, and in forested swamps.[46] In Kazakhstan, riparian forests in lowland steppes and forest-steppes mosaics are thought to be the primary habitat they use.[47] In winter, much like during breeding, they usually occur in wetter habitats than most other eagles, including river deltas with some trees, mangroves, marshes, lakeshores and in India especially jheels.[4] However, greater spotted eagles have been documented in semi-arid Acacia savanna in northeastern Africa.[4] Reportedly in Eritrea, they occurred in open moorland, around villages and lowland grasslands while in Sudan were reportedly usually in shrubby areas.[86][87]  One seen wintering in Ankara in Turkey was in an upland forest area.[88] In the Mediterranean Basin, a study found that the most preferred habitats by far of wintering greater spotted eagles were salt marshes and coastal lagoons with freshwater areas and upland areas much more supplemental.[66] They are not uncommon in paddy fields and sometimes garbage dumps in Asia during winter, being much more adaptable to human-modified areas in this season, though by and large prefer assorted wetlands and mudflats, large rivers, estuaries and mangroves.[29][14][82][89] In Arabia, they are largely found now in manmade habitats, such as sewage farms, reservoirs and irrigated cultivation since the native mangrove and Phragmites reed-beds that once lined the coastal bays and supported the greater spotted eagles was almost entirely eliminated (all habitats used by the late 2000s were created or altered subsequent to 1990).[90] In southern Iran, they are usually found in mangrove areas.[91] Key habitat in Iraq is the Mesopotamian Marshes.[92] Wintering habitats in Israel are the wettest available valleys and damp open zones, chiefly cultivated fields and fish ponds near patches of trees, mainly Eucalyptus with similar habitats used in Oman.[73][90] Greater spotted eagles are typically found from sea level to 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft), mostly below 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) and are characteristically a lowland bird. However, greater spotted eagle may hunt up to 1,700\u00a0m (5,600\u00a0ft), and in passage recorded to 3,800\u00a0m (12,500\u00a0ft) or more in Nepal and 4,000\u00a0m (13,000\u00a0ft) or more in northern Iran.[4] One greater spotted eagle was recorded on migration recorded to at least 4,370\u00a0m (14,340\u00a0ft) in Ladakh in the Himalayas.[29]"}, {"0": "Greater spotted eagles are almost entirely migratory birds. However, it is not usually considered a long-distance migrant compared to other birds of prey.[93] They commence movements by late August or any point in September, with peaks of migration usually falling some time in October. Autumn migration can last more erratically throughout November as well. The return spring flight is quite early, sometimes right around February, with a typical peak of March and into the end of April, seldom to early May.[4][19][56][94] However, migration has been documented well into May, even late into the month, in Bosphorus in Turkey.[95][96] Migration may peak earlier on average farther east, such as in Bhutan, where they often passing in largest numbers by late February.[97][98][99] During migration, they migrate later (by around 2 weeks) than lesser spotted eagles and return earlier than that species as well, with far fewer numbers of the greater than the lesser spotted eagles at nearly all migration sites.[7][29][100] Migratory greater spotted eagles breeding in Europe may move from short to long distances including to southern France, especially Camargue, some down to Spain, Italy and points eastward, sometimes also Sweden. Western breeding birds also regularly wind up in North Africa, with a few in Morocco, maybe Egypt, the Nile Valley and Sudan, some into Ethiopia and points south. Birds from various origin sites may wind up in the Middle East (mainly Arabia), South Asia (from Pakistan, most often Punjab  and Sind, mostly northern India and Nepal), east to Indochina, Malay Peninsula and south and east China.[4] Predominantly, migrating greater spotted eagles on an East European track migrate to the Middle East or Northeast Africa, while other migrate through the Carpathian Mountains to the Balkan Peninsula and thirdly through Central Europe and Western Europe to Southwestern Europe.[93] The main wintering sites of the Asian populations are located in the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent, the Indochina Peninsula and East China.[93] During migration, greater spotted eagles commonly cover around 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) per day but can cover up to 350\u00a0km (220\u00a0mi) within a day.[101][102] The flight speeds of migrating eagles of the species was documented as 26.6 to 45.5\u00a0km/h (16.5 to 28.3\u00a0mph) in the Baikal region, with peak movements times from noon to 6:00 PM.[103]"}, {"0": "There\u2019s limited information on discrepancies in how different ages and sexes migrate but in Malaysia, immatures outnumbered adults six to one.[104] At Lake Baikal, 96% of migrating greater spotted eagles were observed to be adults, a concerning imbalance per researchers.[103] It is said that lesser numbers are generally recorded in spring migration compared to autumn passage.[7] Generally migrants of the species move on broad fronts in singles or pairs, large groups considered as up to 10 in northbound over Bhutan in late February. Greater spotted eagles tend to be scarce at traditional migratory bottlenecks such as Bosphorus  and the straits of the Red Sea.[4][95] Old claims of as many as a thousand migrating eagles in the fall at Bosphorus are possibly erroneous (although there\u2019s possibly been a reduction of up to 75% from what was once the peak migrating numbers).[7] In South Baikal in Irkutsk Oblast within Russia, greater spotted eagles accounted for only 0.2% (7-34 individuals annually; 137 individuals over 8 years) of the observed migrating raptors in autumn migration.[103] The largest (modern?) counts have been found to be 86 and 74 at Suez in Egypt in autumn and spring, respectively, with smaller numbers recorded crossing into Africa at Bab-el-Mandeb, although a maximum of 85 has been recorded in northern Israel in autumn.[94] An adult captured near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia in late October was radiotracked 850\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) to Yemen, where it spent from late November-early February, before returning 5,526\u00a0km (3,434\u00a0mi) via southern Iraq, across the Iranian highlands, skirting the south edge of the Aral Sea back finally to the Siberian breeding area near Omsk, covering 4,516\u00a0km (2,806\u00a0mi) of return journey in less than a month.[4] Satellite tracking has of an Estonian breeding bird confirmed it consistently used the same wintering ground in coastal Catalonia, eastern Spain, over 7 consecutive years.[94] Despite some individual devotedness to wintering grounds, one radiotracked individual initially trapped in the United Arab Emirates was found to go to Pakistan instead the following winter from its Kazakh breeding grounds, showing some variability in this regard.[105] A wintering greater spotted eagle in southwest Saudi Arabia (from a Western Siberia breeding area) was found to utilize an average home range in winter of 65\u00a0km2 (25\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which contracted 24% before it migrated in the spring, taking from late February to late April to complete its over 5,500\u00a0km (3,400\u00a0mi).[106] The southernmost record of the greater spotted eagle ever was one that traveled 9,270\u00a0km (5,760\u00a0mi) from the Polish Biebrza National Park to Zambia in southern Africa.[107] Several other purportedly greater spotted eagles were tracked to several areas of Africa but nearly half were actually hybrids with lesser spotted eagles and were migrating in more typical fashion and location to that species.[102] Improbably, at least seven records show immature greater spotted eagles staying through the summer in Saudi Arabia.[96] Similarly, records show lingering numbers of this species in at least May in Peninsular Malaysia.[82]"}, {"0": "This species hunts mainly on the wing, quartering over relatively open ground a bit like a harrier or soaring high above, dropping or diving steeply when prey is spotted.[4][5] Brown & Amadon describe the hunting greater spotted eagle as \"Although not a very active species it is not exactly sluggish, and on the wing it has the look of a true eagle\".[7] Greater spotted eagles will scatter waterfowl by stooping low over their flock, then selecting isolated individuals for attack.[4] Sometimes the greater spotted eagle still-hunts from a perch, a method more commonly employed by other eagles of similar distribution, and often hunts on foot as well. It mostly takes prey on ground or on the water.[4][5] Also some kleptoparasitic attacks are carried out on other birds of prey.[4] Although scavenging for carrion seems to occur almost aseasonally, it is likely rather more prevalent during non-breeding times, with mostly fresh prey brought to greater spotted eagle nests.[6][5] Greater spotted eagles are attracted often to grass fires and swarming locusts, often along with other predators such as steppe eagles, during non-breeding times.[4] During the breeding season in Biebrza National Park in Poland, hunting behaviours were studied. It was found that the peak flying and hunting times were 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with the eagles rarely flying before 9:00 AM and often in repose from 2:00 to 4:00 PM. Prey deliveries may have been more varied when involving the male, the main food provider, than later into the season when the female resumed hunting. In Biebrza, hunting territories defended from conspecifics as well as lesser spotted eagles and other large birds of prey. Per the Biebrza data, the hunting success was 34% for the male up to mid-July after which success declined to 20%.[108] The hunting success rates of greater spotted eagles seems to rather high, as aforementioned 34% for much of the breeding season, which is much higher at comparable times than golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), which has a hunting success rate of around 20%, lesser spotted eagles with a success rate of 24% and somewhat higher than Bonelli's eagles (Aquila fasciata), at a 28.5% hunting success rate.[109] Pellets are considered the most reliable way to determine greater spotted eagle foods as prey remains alone can be biased towards birds.[29]"}, {"0": "The greater spotted eagle is a slightly opportunistic predator but tends to favor rather particular prey types.[5] The diet tends to be composed mostly of small mammals.[4] There is some dietary similarity to the better-known lesser spotted eagle but the greater spotted includes more birds in foods and favors larger prey.[4] Beyond mammals and birds, the greater spotted eagle will sometimes prey on amphibians, reptiles (mainly small-to-mid-sized snakes) and occasionally small fish and insects.[4][24] As can be expected by their habitat preferences, they tend to focus on vertebrates that are associated with water.[4][19] Generally its prey spectrum is somewhat diverse, at slightly fewer than 150 known prey species, more diverse than the known diet of steppe eagles, similar in diversity to that of the lesser spotted eagle but possibly about half as diverse of the diet of the eastern imperial eagle.[6][5][110][111] It is sometimes stated that they tend to take prey mostly up to only 250\u00a0g (8.8\u00a0oz).[4] This was backed this up via estimations from another source that around 22% of the diet will weigh 63\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0oz) or less, 37% of diet will weigh 63 to 125\u00a0g (2.2 to 4.4\u00a0oz) and around 30% will weigh 125 to 250\u00a0g (4.4 to 8.8\u00a0oz) and that generally most prey will weigh under 1,000\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0lb). Based on this source, the mean estimated prey size for the greater spotted eagle may fall around approximately 157\u00a0g (5.5\u00a0oz).[9] A large food study from Belarus found that 41.9% of prey had a body mass of 51 to 200\u00a0g (1.8 to 7.1\u00a0oz) and 38.3% was made by prey estimated at 11 to 50\u00a0g (0.39 to 1.76\u00a0oz); however, the primary source of prey biomass was from prey weighing 601 to 1,200\u00a0g (1.325 to 2.646\u00a0lb) at 34% of the biomass and prey weighing over 1,200\u00a0g (2.6\u00a0lb) made up 16% of the biomass.[110] The mean estimated size of male prey deliveries in an Estonian study was merely 57.8\u00a0g (2.04\u00a0oz).[112] This is as opposed to study from Belarus where the mean estimated size of prey deliveries by males was 161.2\u00a0g (5.69\u00a0oz).[110] The mean prey sizes are roughly similar to those of larger steppe eagles and somewhat higher than those of lesser spotted eagles, which tended to heavily focus on prey weighing under 63\u00a0g (2.2\u00a0oz) weight range of prey (around 60% of diet), however most Aquila eagles tended to take prey typically that were slightly to considerably higher in weight than the prey typical of greater spotted eagles.[9] However, sometimes the greater spotted eagle is credited with successful attacks on large prey.[5][19]"}, {"0": "In the largest known food study for greater spotted eagle the diet was studied in 3 different habitats in Belarusian Polesia, from natural to mixed to modified habitats. 797 prey items were identified total, but often not to species. Many, surprisingly, were unidentified invertebrates which made up 15.8%, with beetles (also unidentified to species) being a further 14.9%. Assorted Microtus voles were important in Polesia, namely  the common (Microtus arvalis), tundra (Microtus oeconomus) and East European voles (Microtus mystacinus) made up collectively 23.4% of the diet by number. Other significant prey were European water vole (Arvicola terrestris) at 8.9%, common snipe (Gallinago gallinago) at 4.1%, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) at 3.3%, water rail (Rallus aquaticus) 3.1%, unidentified small passerines 2.9%, spotted crakes (Porzana porzana) 2.6% and grass snakes (Natrix natrix) 2.3%. Significant in biomass but less so to numbers were the northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus), European mole (Talpa europaea), Anas dabbling ducks, grey herons (Ardea cinerea), Eurasian bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) and black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), with very small numbers of very large birds being taken. Bird prey in Polesia made up 68% of the diet, mammals 25.3%, reptiles 3.4%, fish 3% and amphibians 0.3%.[110] Of 102 prey items in the Belarusian Smolenskoye Poozerye National Park, 38.2% were European water voles, 7.8% were European moles, 5.9% each Sorex shrews, Microtus voles, and unidentified passerine species and 8.7% were common frogs.[113] At a nest in Estonia, of 105 visually identified prey items, Microtus species and further unidentified rodents comprised some 63% by number, however they made up only 28% by biomass, while birds formed only 19% numerically but 56% of biomass.45% of avian prey species were medium-sized, e.g. hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia), grey partridge (Perdix perdix), northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and hooded crow (Corvus cornix).[112] Other European studies have been largely confined to wintering greater spotted eagles. In the Amvrakikos Wetlands of Greece, 95 prey items were determined, being composed almost exclusively of water birds. The main prey here were common teal (Anas crecca) (17.9% by number, 15.9% by biomass), common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) (16.8% by number, 14.9% by biomass), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope ) (11.6% in number, 27.4% in biomass), unidentified Anas ducks (5.3%, 7.8% in biomass), Eurasian coot (Fulica atra) (4.2% by number, 8.7% by biomass) and little egret (Egretta garzetta) (3.2% by number, 4.7% biomass), with a smallish contribution by ground beetles, passerines and snakes.[114] Over 8 years of study in Natural Park of El Fondo in the Spanish Province of Alicante almost entirely large prey was taken here, i.e. few to none small rodents such as voles. Among the 100 prey items found, the main prey were common moorhen (23.1% by number, 15.2% in biomass), common teal (8.97% by number, 6.44% by biomass) and black rat (Rattus rattus) (7.69% by number, 3.01% by biomass), with unidentified Rattus making up 7.69%  by number, 2.76% by biomass. Other notable regular prey here were black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), Eurasian coots and northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), while large prey, making up much of the biomass were common carp (Cyprinus carpio) at 18.9% of biomass, grey heron at 11.7% of biomass and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) at 9% of the biomass.[115]"}, {"0": "In nests in Western Russia, a mean total of 53% of the diet was small mammals and 45% was birds.[112] The diet upon study in the Leningrad region was led by European water vole at nearly 51% of 79 prey items followed by introduced muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) at 13.9% of diet and common teal 3.8% of diet, with 20.2% of diet made up of by frogs, most probably common (Rana arvalis) but also some moor frogs (Rana temporaria).[116] 322 non-carrion prey items were found for greater spotted eagles in the Belaya River, 59% of which were mammals. The diet was largely European water vole at 32.6%, followed by smaller voles and mice. It was found that the Belaya eagles ate a large balances of reptile prey, which were found to comprise 19.5% of the diet. 15% of all vertebrate prey, in fact, was European adders (Vipera berus), adders and grass snakes being the primary reptile prey. The greater spotted eagle took average sized snakes and were not seen to prey on small snakes, nor to take many particularly large snakes, usually with the snake sizes estimated at up to 40 to 45\u00a0cm (16 to 18\u00a0in) long, occasionally 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) or more. The eagles in Belaya are often seen grasping snakes about the head. In Belaya, only 6.5% of the diet was birds and they were mainly significant only in the Oka Nature Reserve and the eagles of the region occasionally partook in carrion feeding, including moose (Alces alces) carcasses.[117] In a compilation study from the Volga region, Ural Mountains and Western Siberia, 74.7% of the diet was mammalian in 482 prey items in the regions. The main prey species was the European water vole at an average of 32.4% of diet (28.1-36.8%), followed by common vole at avg 11.4% (0-17%), tundra vole at 6.2% (1.9-16.9%), birds comprised about 16% of diet, most importantly Eurasian coots and Podiceps grebes, followed by rooks (Corvus frugilegus).[6] In the Tyva Republic, more terrestrial, upland hunting can be projected since the Daurian pika (Ochotona dauurica) was reportedly the main prey for greater spotted eagles. Similarly, in Khakassia, the greater spotted eagle were said to hunt mostly the long-tailed ground squirrel (Spermophilus undulatus), the only area known where ground squirrels were said to be preferred over voles in breeding areas for these eagles.[118]"}, {"0": "The diet is generally more erratically known in non-European wintering areas, while, like many other raptors of similar region, migrating greater spotted eagles typically fast until they reach their wintering terminus point.[7][5] The most well-studied Asian wintering population of the species in terms of dietary behaviour is likely in Bharatpur in India, particularly in Keoladeo National Park. It was found that the greater spotted eagles here occupied a greater range of habitat than other spotted and Aquila eagle. Winter numbers are up to 30 for this species, with them recorded to exploit the full 9\u00a0km (5.6\u00a0mi) length of the local marshland, their numbers peaking in November and December and then diminishing after January. Here greater spotted eagles are non-territorial and free ranging. Like most other wintering migrant raptors here, the greater spotted eagle becomes a highly opportunistic feeder that shows a preference for easily attainable foods, akin to the milvine kites they often overlap with in the winter quarters. The greater spotted eagles regularly come down to carrion, pirate food from other birds, feed on stranded fish and, perhaps most regularly, hunting and taking young herons, storks and other water birds from heronries. When regularly hunting around them, the greater spotted eagles often approach the heronry in a hover, creating tumult throughout the heronry, as the heronry settles they often suddenly drop onto singled out nest, the eagle defeathers the squab (nestling water bird) on the nest itself and commences feeding. The Bharatpur greater spotted eagles tend to shows a slight preference for slow moving prey, but also takes fast flying birds like waders and ducks and often tests flocks of coots with low flights over water and continually \"buzzing\" the birds until an opportunity presents itself via an individual isolated. Often perches extensively on a favorite lookout post with Acacia nilotica favored in Bharatpur. Some possible nighttime hunting has been inferred for greater spotteds in Bharatpur but they typically hunt by day. During inclement weather in Bharatpur, the eagles may pause hunting. As many as 7-10 greater spotted eagles are attracted by a conspecific\u2019s heronry kill and subsequently often jostle each other. Often this results in the eagle\u2019s accidentally drop the kill into the water, though those dropped onto dry ground frequently become food for wild boars (Sus scrofa) and golden jackals (Canis aureus). In one case, two adult greater spotted eagles and a single immature eastern imperial eagle destroyed at least 30 water bird nests in a single day. Out of 79 hours of observation on greater spotted eagles, 49% of the time was spent foraging, increasing to 72% by March due to scarcer foods. Meanwhile, they spent 26.4% of observed time resting and 20.6% of the time soaring, with soaring rising to 35% in February. The greater spotted eagles consumed a daily mean of 240\u00a0g (8.5\u00a0oz) per day, with most foods nourishing them over several days, and they reportedly hunted the most diverse prey range of any raptor of the region.[5][119][120][121][122] In the general Indian subcontinent, greater spotted eagles are known to freely scavenge carrion, as well as to feed on small wetland dwellers such as frogs, especially Indus valley bullfrogs (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus), and chameleons and Calotes lizards on land nearby. A general aptitude in the region has been reported for avian prey, largely larger rails such as moorhens, Eurasian coots and gray-headed swamphens (Porphyrio poliocephalus), as well as waterfowl and (mostly young) storks, herons and egrets; however upland birds such as rufous treepies (Dendrocitta vagabunda), Eurasian collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) and Indian rollers (Coracias benghalensis) seem to be in the spectrum there too. Though rare at large carrion, greater spotted eagles in the Indian subcontinent seem to be attracted to terrapins maimed or partially eaten by Pallas's fish eagles (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), Egyptian (Neophron percnopterus) and red-headed vultures (Sarcogyps calvus). The Indian wintering eagles do not appear to shun hunting terrestrial creatures and have been seen to hunting also snakes, rodents and other small mammals in the region.[5][29][123]"}, {"0": "Ancedotal evidence of the diet of wintering greater spotted eagles was attained in the central plains of Thailand. Here they were seen to eat dead fish in drained ponds as well as to actively hunt and to pirate food from other raptors. They were seen to prey on domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) that became separated from their large farm flocks as well as to feed on dead lesser whistling ducks (Dendrocygna javanica) found to be killed by poisons meant to kill off snails.[80] One farther prey species reported to be likely highly important to this region\u2019s greater spotted eagles is the ricefield rat (Rattus argentiventer).[4][29] Despite not being an eagle considered to show an aptitude for attacking large or varied prey, sometimes greater spotted eagles seem to be capable of taking very varied and sometimes substantially sized prey.[5][9][108] It has been detected that small invertebrates may be taken at times, including ground beetles, locusts and non-native red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).[110][115] The greater spotted eagle takes a range of birds ranging down to the size of the 18.4\u00a0g (0.65\u00a0oz) common reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus). They can take fairly large water birds up to the size of grey herons, mallards, fledgling painted storks (Mycteria leucocephala), Asian openbills and greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) as well as some cormorants and flamingoes. Most such water bird prey may weigh somewhere between 1,200 and 3,000\u00a0g (2.6 and 6.6\u00a0lb).[5][28][110][115][124] Sometimes the greater spotted eagle will attack or feed on cranes, although they not infrequently scavenge these as well. Many attacks attempted against cranes are reportedly unsuccessful against these tough prey. Likely cases of predation on adult common cranes (Grus grus) have been reported while one a demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) was unsuccessful while they were considered a potential threat possibly to the young of red-crowned cranes (Grus japonica). In some cases, they may taking cranes weighing up to some 5,000\u00a0g (11\u00a0lb).[110][125][126] Outside of avian prey, less varied prey is known to be taken of other taxa, though mammals have been taken ranging from Eurasian harvest mouse (Micromys minutus) and common shrew (Sorex araneus), weighing no more than 8\u00a0g (0.28\u00a0oz) up to the size of a nearly grown European hare (Lepus europaeus), potentially weighing up to 3,000\u00a0g (6.6\u00a0lb). Sometimes greater spotted eagles may prey upon around a half dozen species of mustelid mostly assorted weasels and stoats but also including larger species such as minks and martens.[108][110][127][128]"}, {"0": "Greater spotted eagles often overlap broadly with a number of similar eagle species in both its breeding and wintering haunts.[4][24] Although they are most obviously similar in dietary biology to the lesser spotted eagles, in the larger portion of their breeding range, the greater spotted eagles are allopatric from the lesser spotted.[41] Where they do overlap, the greater spotted eagle has a somewhat similar diet to that of the lesser spotted eagles but tends to focus more so water-friendly species and to take relatively more birds, whereas the lesser spotted eagle often focuses variously on voles, small snakes such as grass snakes and frogs.[129] Expectedly from its prey, the lesser spotted eagle tends to nest in slightly drier environments, usually somewhat away from wetlands and floodplains, adapting rather more readily to patchwork areas where human development has occurred.[8][85][130] More similar in central distribution are larger eagles such as the eastern imperial eagle and steppe eagle.[4][7] Furthermore, these species undertake roughly similar migratory routes, though the steppe is clearly the most populous and regular migrant (in spite of its extreme decline), appearing in numbers from Africa to South Asia, while the greater spotted and eastern imperial eagles are regular to as far west as the Middle East and appear scarcely to rarely in Africa.[131][132][133] The greater spotted eagles is clearly partitioned, however, from the other eagles in its favoring of wet and partial wooded habitats and liking for animals that dwell in them as prey. The eastern imperial eagle also nests in woods but usually in rather upland areas and favors both social and solitary terrestrial mammals and birds, including hares, hamsters, ground squirrels and hedgehogs as well as pheasants, corvids and other mid-sized birds.[134][135]  Meanwhile, the steppe eagle favours typically rather dry and very open habitats in the steppe, usually nesting on a rise or outcrop in the flat, sparse habitat, and much favours ground squirrels, supplemented by other rather small terrestrial species such as pikas, voles and zokors.[136][137] Usually habitat keeps these eagles rather separated from the greater spotted eagle while nesting, however in some winter quarters such as India, the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East, considerable convergence occurs.[5][119][124][138] All three eagles are well established to be rather unpicky opportunists and scavengers during winter, freely coming to human refuse, though favoring livestock carcass dumps, scavenging unclaimed carrion, robbing other birds of prey of their catches, killing the young of prey such as water birds, finding insect swarms or emergences (though more so the steppe than the others) and following grass fires. Of these three, the steppe tends to be least actively predatory in winter typically, the imperial the most likely to continue to live-hunt (and perch most extensively) and the greater spotted eagle somewhere in the intermediate behavioral zone. The greater spotted is the least likely of the three to visit carrion or carcass dumps but in the Indian subcontinent, they all heavily share food sources such as nestling water birds.[4][5][119][120] When conflicts arise, the body size of eagle imparts its position in the hierarchy, with the eastern imperial eagle dominant, followed by the steppe eagle while the greater spotted eagle is somewhat subservient to both. The three eagles were well studied in Bharatpur, where they competed against the shorter distance migrant, the Pallas's fish eagle, which vied with the imperial eagles for the dominant raptor position while all the larger eagles dominated the smaller competing resident Indian spotted eagles.[120] A non-eagle raptor often associated with wintering greater spotted eagles, attracted to similar feeding opportunities, is the black kite (Milvus migrans).[139]"}, {"0": "While scavenging, the greater spotted eagles tend not to come to carrion if Old World vultures are present.[5] The greater spotted eagles is an accomplished pirate during the winter season. They often rob a variety of other raptors including black kites (Milvus migrans), ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), western (Circus aeruginosus) and eastern marsh harriers (Circus spilonotus) and even other eagles including larger species like white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and steppe eagles. Despite their typically inferior position to them, the greater spotted eagle was observed to often successfully displaced the steppe eagle in Bharatpur from disputed food, with the steppes being more tractable when gorged. They tend to rob the other raptor aerially when the victim is trying to take initial flight with the prey, taking advantage of the other bird\u2019s attempt to balance itself, during which they yank away the prey and escape fairly rapidly.[5][80][119][123][140] More infrequently, greater spotted eagles will exploit other raptors as prey. Some species they been known to prey have including black kites, booted eagles (Hieraeetus pennatus), western marsh harriers and common buzzards (Buteo buteo) as well as some owls like long-eared (Asio otus) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Additionally, they were considered a potential predator of small nestlings of the Eurasian griffon (Gyps fulvus).[5][110][115][141] The greater spotted eagles themselves have few well documented predators.[7] While this is probably due in part to scant research, usually as a quite large and powerful bird of prey, it usually fulfills the role of an apex predator.[24][127] However, one well documented predator of likely any aged greater spotted eagles is the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo).[142][143] Furthermore, European pine martens are known to feed on nestlings of greater spotted eagles.[108]"}, {"0": "Often the greater spotted eagle occurs in pairs or solitary, but in winter sometimes occurs in small to large flocks, especially around attractive food source.[4] The species is often seen singly seen in migration, though sometimes in twos or threes or more.[4] The display of this eagle on territory is not well known but includes single or mutual high circling, soaring high and the male diving down on half-closed wings towards the female, all with much calling.[4] Territories can be from 15 to 30\u00a0km2 (5.8 to 11.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in ideal regions, usually within the confines of a protected area, though are much larger elsewhere.[29] In the past, it has been reported that greater spotted eagle nests have been found as close as 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) from each other and in one case 4 pairs nested in an area of merely 0.6\u00a0km2 (0.23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), a more typical range may be in the zone of 40 to 52\u00a0km2 (15 to 20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[7] The density of greater spotted eagles was 4.76 (per confirmed numbers) to 6.15 (per projections based on available habitat) breeding pairs per 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of forested area in the Volga-Ural region while in the Western Siberia region, it was 6.55 to 8.76 breeding pairs in the metric estimates on 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[6] The highest density though was in Volga-Ural area, with up to 3.58-17.01 pairs where the locally preferred habitat (flooded alders) was available. The mean distance between nests in the Volga-Ural area was 7.3\u00a0km2 (2.8\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[6] In the Ishim River basin of Kazakhstan there are about 0.54 pairs per 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), while in the Kazakh Irtysh pine forests there was a density of 1.08 pairs per 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in internal edges of pine forests and a much higher density of 13.23 pairs per 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of edges of forests along lakes and bogs in the Irtysh basin. However, the possible highest density of pairs in Kazakhstan is possibly the region of the Ishim River, holding perhaps 39% of the nation\u2019s breeding pairs.[144] Based on wintering greater spotted eagles in Spain, a wintertime territory may be similar or slightly smaller, at around 27.2\u00a0km2 (10.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[145] Furthermore, in well suited Russian habitats, nests were said (at least historically) to be found every 1.6\u00a0km (0.99\u00a0mi) of riverside, with fairly consistent pair reuse in following years.[7] This species breeds from late April to August in much of its range.[4] However, when breeding in Pakistan and elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent, they may do so in different reports from November to March, sometimes further into June to July, indicating an inconsistent nesting schedule there.[4][5]"}, {"0": "The species builds a large stick nest which may measure about 70 to 110\u00a0cm (28 to 43\u00a0in) across and be up to 100\u00a0cm (39\u00a0in) deep.[4] Apparently nests appeared significantly smaller in the Indian subcontinent than in their more typical northerly nesting haunts, at around 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) across, shorter than the eagle\u2019s own total length, and merely around 5 to 15\u00a0cm (2.0 to 5.9\u00a0in) deep.[5] The nests built by this species tend to have some particular features.[6] Namely, the species tends to utilize fresh branches with foliage or green needles (where nesting in conifer predominated forests) still attached for their nest sticks (most other acciptrids prefer sparse or leafless branches while building nests).[6] Nests are lined with green leaves, pine needles and grass, as is common in accipitrids, and they may be added continuously throughout the breeding cycle.[4][7] The nest is normally located in a tree usually in the main fork, a large lateral branch or even the top of typically large broadleaf trees just inside forests.[4][6] Russian compilation studies reflect that about 68.7% of found greater spotted eagle nests were on deciduous trees with the remaining balance in coniferous trees.[6] In the Russian Nizhny Novgorod region nests were typically located on birches (10 out of 11 that were found) and one on a black alder (Alnus glutinosa).[146] In Poland, birch such as downy birch (Betula pubescens) appear popular in use.[108] In the Volga-Ural area, alder forests were preferred, with 71.4% of pairs with found active nests using it, while in Western Siberia they prefer pine forests, 55.9% of the time.[6] Within the Altai-Sayan region, preferred nest trees were birch (50% of the time) and larch trees (31.25% of the time).[118] Acacia arabica and Mangifera indica were reportedly used in Pakistan, and Mitragyna parvifolia in India, and were reportedly sometimes even on agricultural land.[5][29] In essentially every Russian study, nests were almost invariably in floodplain forests.[6][118][146] Nesting sites in the Volga-Ural area averaged 510.7\u00a0m (1,676\u00a0ft) from the nearest forest edge, but were often in the densest part of the forest stands.[147] The nest can be 5 to 25\u00a0m (16 to 82\u00a0ft) above the ground or water, though usually 8 to 12\u00a0m (26 to 39\u00a0ft).[4] In Nizhny Novgorod, nest heights were from 7 to 14\u00a0m (23 to 46\u00a0ft) above the ground [146] From a sample of 83, in the Volga-Ural area, the average nest height was 9.58\u00a0m (31.4\u00a0ft) while in Western Siberia it was 7.22\u00a0m (23.7\u00a0ft), ranging variously from 3 to 20\u00a0m (9.8 to 65.6\u00a0ft), nest sites appearing lower in the more conifer based Western Siberia area.[6] Nest heights were lower still at a mean of 6.5\u00a0m (21\u00a0ft) in the Altai-Sayan region.[118] Rarely, nests are recorded in treeless regions in shrubs, for instance in a Western Siberian steppe on a Salix shrub at just under 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) above the ground.[4] A nest in Altai-Sayan was reportedly only 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) above the ground.[118] Even more rarely, nests have been reportedly located on the ground.[29] At times, they may use the nests of other birds, most likely other birds of prey but even a Eurasian magpie (Pica pica) nest was reportedly once used.[29][148]"}, {"0": "In Russia, they reportedly seldom lay eggs until May, but sometimes as early as late April, with similar if mildly earlier laying times farther west.[7][29] The clutch size is typically two though sometimes the nest contains one to three eggs.[4][7] The eggs are broad ovals that are grayish white in colour and tend to be glossless and often unmarked. However, sometimes they may manifest a few dark brown spots or blotches and sparse grey shell-marks.[7] The eggs may range in height from 63 to 74\u00a0mm (2.5 to 2.9\u00a0in), with an average of 67.5\u00a0mm (2.66\u00a0in) in one sample and 68.9\u00a0mm (2.71\u00a0in) in another, by 47.8 to 56.7\u00a0mm (1.88 to 2.23\u00a0in) in diameter, with an average of 54\u00a0mm (2.1\u00a0in) and 54.4\u00a0mm (2.14\u00a0in).[6][7][149] The incubation stage lasts 42\u201344 days per most sources, but in southern Belarus, an incubation stage of only 39 days was documented.[4][150] Incubation begins with the first egg.[7] The male of the pair was once thought to not to take part in incubation (typically, as in many raptors, they primarily have the responsibility of prey deliveries).[7] However, in the aforementioned Belarusian study, the male incubated an average of 57.3 minutes during daylight.[150] In the Altai taiga region, among 6 greater spotted eagle territories, the average brood size was 1.33 nestling per successful nest or 1.0 nestling per occupied nest. Two of the Altai greater spotted eagle territories were on the abandoned territories of eastern imperial eagles.[151] Meanwhile, in the Volga-Ural and Western Siberia areas, the mean brood sizes were 1.24 and 1.42, respectively.[6] The body size between the greater spotted eagle nestlings differs markedly when the second eaglet hatches and the younger usually dies, often via siblicide.[7] Competition often resulting in starvation or intentional killing of the younger chick by its elder sibling is not uncommon in birds of prey, especially the eagles, and is often hypothesized as a kind of insurance process wherein the younger sibling acts an insurance if the elder sibling is somehow killed, otherwise the younger sibling (which is not necessarily in ill health) is possibly expected to die.[152][153] However, this species raises two fledglings at least somewhat more commonly than the lesser spotted eagle.[7][154] Out of 50 nests in the Oka Nature Reserve, though, only one pair managed to produce two fledglings in a year.[155] In an experiment in a nest in Poland, a younger sibling was taken out of the nest to save it, with the younger eaglet weighing 310\u00a0g (11\u00a0oz) against 1,050\u00a0g (2.31\u00a0lb) for the older sibling at the point of extraction. After being taken out of the nest, the younger eaglet was raised with minimal interactions, to avoid imprinting, beyond feeding in captivity by humans. The eaglet shared a cage with an eastern imperial eagle and a lesser spotted eagle both of which were indifferent towards and did not in any way care for or feed the young greater spotted eagle. At the point of fledgling the young eagle was successfully reintroduced to its own parent's nest, fledged and attained independence.[155] The mother greater spotted eagle can be a somewhat tight sitter but can abandon the nest when disturbed by humans, in a Belarusian study for a full day before returning.[7][150] By late July to early August, the young are fully feathered, soon takes its first flight in not more than 5 days.[7] Fledgling is at 60\u201367 days, averaging close to 62 days.[4] In Altai-Sayan region, the mean number of fledglings per successful nest could vary from a mean of 1 per nest in Tuva to 1.8 in Khakassia.[118] In Kazakh studies, a mean of 1.38 fledglings were produced in 11 nests.[144] In Western Siberia, a mean of 1.44 fledglings were produced in 66 broods.[156] Further dependence on the parents lasts to 30 days more after fledgling.[4] Before dispersing for good, the young greater spotted eagles may wander locally into the open steppe for a little while.[7] Female greater spotted eagles were found to leave 2\u20133 days before their young in a study in Poland,. Meanwhile, the male tends to leave leave last, at about 1 week after the female. In the Polish study, adults headed straight for Bosphorus while juveniles were sometimes less direct.[157] Most were gone from Poland by the end of September, juveniles also seen to wander in elsewhere in Poland during autumn before finally migrating.[157]"}, {"0": "At one time, it is possible that greater and lesser spotted eagles were largely isolated from each other via different habitat usage, although the ranges may have long since abutted one another.[3] Possibly at the conclusion of the last ice age at some point early in the Holocene permitted forest growth where there were once grassy boundaries, allowing the two species of spotted eagles to expand into each other\u2019s ranges.[3][158] Hybridization is now known to occur extensively with hybrids occurring in the entire overlapping range of the two species, which is some 600,000\u00a0km2 (230,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), with interbreeding mostly determined via conjecture in the European Russia area, where hybridization possibly occurred the most recently (this being the eastern limits roughly of the lesser spotted eagle\u2019s range).[10][146][159] Hybrids between the species often show a nape patch, absent in pure greater spotted eagles, an intermediate amount of spotting about the wings and a typically larger body size than pure lesser spotted eagles.[160] Despite their intermediate characteristics and larger size than lesser spotteds, the hybridization of the species is thought to be an indication of the abandonment of greater spotted eagle territories and the replacement of them by the more adaptive and populous lesser spotted eagles, as was indicated in an Estonian study.[10] The Estonian study reflected that the number of hybrid greater-lesser spotted eagle pairs was twice as high in the nation than pure greater spotted eagles.[10] The situation was even graver in Lithuania where not a single pure pair of greater spotted eagles could be found any longer by the mid-2000s, with only 2.7% of 161 breeding spotted eagles being greater spotteds, the rest being lesser spotted eagles.[161] Lesser spotted eagles were estimated to number around 1000 breeding pairs in Lithuania, with an estimated 37 or so of these containing one mate that is a greater spotted eagle.[161] Both Polish and Estonian studies reflected a probable high turnover of mates in hybrid pairs, with the Polish data finding about 71% of the males of the pairs being supplemented in subsequent years.[10][162] Furthermore the Polish data shows that the hybrids are favouring the habitats of lesser spotted eagles farther away from the wetter habitats of the greater spotted eagle and often nearer human development, with a local 50% reduction of pure greater spotted eagle pairs and 30% increase in hybrid pairs. The habitat alterations to the environment by humans are thought in general to be partially beneficial to lesser spotted eagles and normally harmful to greater spotted eagles.[162][163]"}, {"0": "Despite maintaining a fairly vast breeding range, covering at least 9 million square kilometers, in a band from the Baltic Sea in Europe right across to the Pacific Ocean with minor outpost in the Indian subcontinent, this eagle occurs at extremely low densities.[4] The populations and trends of the species have been considered fairly poorly studied in the past, but a strong declining trend has been detected.[4][29] Rough estimates in the 1990s indicated some 11 pairs in a huge area of northeastern Poland, around 2,000\u00a0km2 (770\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and only some 20-30 pairs in a huge study area of 85,000\u00a0km2 (33,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in European Russia, with no more than 900 pairs west of the Urals.[4] More refined subsequent efforts put the number of breeding pairs in the European Union at 810 to 1100 breeding pairs.[19] Furthermore, in the 1990s, it was extrapolated from Indian wintering populations that the more eastern population is surely less than four figures.[4] Birdlife International in the 1990s estimated the Russian population at 2800-3000 pairs. More recently, Birdlife has estimated the global population as no more than 3800-13,200 total mature individuals worldwide.[1][4][29] Color-banding recovery studies have determined that of 1370 European band recoveries of spotted eagles, only 3.6% were greater spotted eagles, while hybrid greater x lesser spotted eagles comprised 2.7%, the remaining numbering being all lesser spotted eagles.[164]  Greater spotted eagles are considered extripated as a breeding species from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic (where they may have never consistently bred) and Slovakia, as well as Israel where they last bred in the 1960s. Meanwhile, the Finland breeding population is also likely almost gone.[4][29][19] Steady reduction in Ukraine down to 40-50 pairs by 1985 and a 12-20% overall reduction of the Ukrainian population was estimated, from 1920s to 1990s.[4][165] The numbers of greater spotted eagles in Estonia declined 14% in the period merely from 2004 to 2010, with declines having been detected for some time there.[11][166] The number of breeding pairs in Belarus is as many 150-200 pairs (with confirmed counts of somewhat over 100 breeding pairs) and this is considered the most important breeding area known outside of Russia.[19]"}, {"0": "Where the total numbers in European Russia were once estimated at around 1000 breeding pairs in the 1960s, it is estimated that there are fewer than 700 pairs left there.[29][167] The range has shrunk in the Russian Far East, where it once widely found but is now restricted to below the middle Amur, along the Ussuri and south Primorsky although anecdotal information suggests that it is still somewhat common in the whole Western Siberian lowlands from the Ural Mountains to the middle Ob River.[29] In Kazakhstan, there are an estimated 74-97 breeding pairs of the species.[144] Wintering estimates are more scattered and efforts to tabulate numbers in India show they continue to occur quite broadly but in perhaps slightly lowered and more scattered numbers.[5][168][169][170] In Armenia, it is considered one of the two rarest of the nation\u2019s 30 raptor species, along with the eastern imperial eagle.[171] Wintering numbers of greater spotted eagles in the Mediterranean Basin were found to total about 300-400 individuals, with a bit under 34% of these in Israel, just under 32% in Greece, 16% in Turkey, somewhat smaller numbers in Romania and Spain and tiny numbers in Southeastern Europe, Montenegro and France.[66] Around 50 individuals winter in Turkey per other sources.[88] The species appears fairly rarely in Ethiopia and Eretria where they are seen singly and sparsely in most cases.[71] In essentially every nation of its distribution, the greater spotted eagle has a Vulnerable status.[19] As a species, the greater spotted eagle is classified as vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN.[1]"}, {"0": "The primary threats are habit degradation and habitat loss.[1][29] Greater spotted eagles appear to be highly sensitive to habitat alterations, especially drainage of wetlands, intensified agricultural practices and abandonment of floodplain management practices.[85][172] Detrimental wetland management processes have additionally effected the species on their wintering grounds, where in Saudi Arabia at least, the effect has been offset by the greater spotted eagles adapting to man-made bodies of water (unlike in winter, though, there is no evidence that they adapt well to man-made areas during breeding).[173][174] The amount of usable manmade habitats has shrunk in Thailand with a change to dry season rice field cropping and the creeping presence of urbanization, along with probable rodenticide usage and other poisonings, likely harming numbers of the species able to winter there.[80] Other threats are known to include human disturbance during the mating season, with forestry operations known now to be a major cause of disturbance at the nest site.[29][172] Furthermore, greater spotted eagles are threatened by mostly inadvertent poisonings and collisions with man-made objects, especially electrical wires.[4][175] Poisonings were known to be a serious cause of mortality in Shanxi reserve of China where the eagles were seen to hunt down sickly or dying common pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) that had been poisoned and then subsequently dying themselves, this becoming the primary local source of mortality.[29][176] In the Malay Peninsula, subsequent to a brief increase of the species from the 1960s to the 1980s due to environmental changes favorable to avian scavengers, a crash in numbers down to almost none there was thought to be quite likely due to pesticide and other poison usage.[19][82] The real trends of greater spotted eagles are sometimes masked by misidentifications.[4] Furthermore, as aforementioned, the species is at threat of hybridization and ultimate supplanting by the lesser spotted eagle as that species\u2019 range creeps farther east.[3][10] The greater spotted eagle is legally protected in a scattered amount of nations, making conservation efforts difficult.[1][29] Among the nations where they are legally protected are Belarus, Estonia, France, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia and nominally in Thailand. A working group specifically to address spotted eagles has been established as of the 21st century.[1][29][177] The working groups have managed to undertake conservation efforts in Belarus, Estonia and the Ukraine, among the core breeding areas left in Europe for the species and they\u2019ve successfully instituted restrictions of forestry activities near the nest sites during the breeding season.[1][29][177] The building of artificial nest platforms did not seem to greatly aid greater spotted eagles in Nizhny Novgorod, unlike other raptors such as the osprey, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and the golden eagle, as only one pair of greater spotteds were recorded to use a platform as a nest and higher survey numbers of greater spotted eagles in that region were likely only due to more extensive surveying.[146][178] In an exceptional positive note, it was found the European population of greater spotted eagle, as studied via microsatellites, retains quite high genetic diversity, meaning that there is no eminent threat of a genetic bottleneck for the species.[3][179][180]"}, {"0": "Hirundo cucullata"}, {"0": "The greater striped swallow  (Cecropis cucullata) is a large swallow that is native to Africa south of the equator."}, {"0": "The greater striped swallow was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Cape of Good Hope district of South Africa.[1] The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.[2]  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Hirundo cucullata in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin\u00e9es.[3] The greater striped swallow is now one of nine species that are placed in the genus Cecropis that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826.[4][5] The species is monotypic and no subspecies are recognised.[5] The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek Kekropis \"Athenian woman\".

This disincentivizes seeking flowers outside of a hummingbird's adaptive niche, and allows for a system of ecosystem resource partitioning.[9]"}, {"0": "The green-fronted lancebill, having a particularly long and slightly upturned bill, has not been identified as having a single species partner but would benefit most from flowers with equally long corollas bearing a slight curve."}, {"0": "The green-fronted lancebill feeds on the nectar of epiphytes, including mistletoe."}, {"0": "During nest construction only the female green-fronted lancebill works to construct the nests.\u00a0 Nest site location is consistently attached to the side of a vertical overhang in which the nest is covered by the surface it is attached to i.e. a cliff face where the top of the cliff shelters the nest from rain and other weather.

This effect has also been observed in other parrot species.[18]"}, {"0": "Research has shown that by planning asynchronous hatching, parent parrotlets don't have to spend as much time expending the high levels of energy associated with brooding, but the amount of energy expended does not change.[19]"}, {"0": "It has been observed that over the course of mating and raising a brood of chicks, a female green-rumped parrotlet's mass varies greatly.

It hops or runs when on the ground.[15] Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a fruit tree if one is found.[37] The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five,[38] while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the non-breeding season.[15]"}, {"0": "There is some evidence of territoriality, as birds in the Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there.[36] The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby.[15] The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.[39]"}, {"0": "Two species of chewing louse have been isolated and described from grey currawongs: (Menacanthus dennisi) from subspecies halmaturina on Kangaroo Island in South Australia,[40] and Australophilopterus strepericus from subspecies arguta near Launceston in Tasmania.[41] A new species of spirurian nematode, Microtetrameres streperae isolated from a grey currawong at Waikerie was described in 1977.[42] The parasitic alveolate Isospora streperae was described from a grey currawong (subspecies plumbea) from Western Australia.[43]"}, {"0": "The breeding habits of the grey currawong are not well known, and the inaccessibility of its nests makes study difficult. The breeding season lasts from August to December. The grey currawong builds a large shallow nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees; generally eucalypts are chosen.[27] It produces a clutch of one to five (though usually two or three) rounded or tapered oval eggs, which vary in size and colour according to subspecies.

In all subspecies, the markings can coalesce over the larger end of the egg to form a darker 'cap'. The incubation period is poorly known because of the difficulty of observing nests, but one observation suggested around 23\u00a0days from laying to hatching. Like all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous). Both parents feed the young.[25]"}, {"0": "Data on nesting success rates is limited; one study of 35 nests found that 28 (80%) resulted in the fledging of at least one young currawong.

In a recent study, there is a hypothesis explaining nest abandonment in this species. Abandoned nests could be used for confusing predators. In fact, a large number of abandoned nests exposed on trees are significantly less concealed than nests that eventually received eggs. However, these abandoned nests were incompletely built, probably in response to the attention of predators (such as pied currawongs), because these predators may destroy incomplete nests when looking for eggs.[12] In addition, pied currawongs are larger than grey fantails, which presents a considerable risk for adult grey fantails. Therefore, desertion might be an adaptation of grey fantails, with these nests used for eliminating hazards from cryptic predation.[3] Some of the materials from decoy nests could be used to construct the subsequent breeding nest. The location of the breeding nest varies during the nest-building phase, ensuring a site with sufficient security to prepare for breeding.[13] The parent birds build compact, cup-shaped nests, usually in the forks of trees, made from moss, bark and fibre, and often completed with spider's web. According to the records of the sizes of the nests by Richard and Donaghey, which were observed in three regions of southern Australia, the average size of nests were 5.7\u00a0cm (5.1-6.4\u00a0cm) external diameter, 4.1\u00a0cm (3.8-4.4\u00a0cm) internal diameter, and 2.9\u00a0cm (2.5-3.2\u00a0cm) internal depth.[14]"}, {"0": "The grey fantail is territorial and it is a seasonal breeder.  They raise several broods per season, usually each of three or four cream eggs, spotted grey and brown. The incubation period is around two weeks, with incubation and feeding duties shared by both parents. During the breeding season, the mass of testes of male grey fantails grows larger than in the non-breeding season.[15] The growth of testes sizes could be subject to sperm competition, similar to other species exhibiting morphological traits.[3] Male birds also have pronounced cloacal protuberances. This change of morphology is associated with polygynandry and the increase in copulation chance. Despite most grey fantails forming season-long monogamous pairs, a small number of male birds seeking extra-pair copulation have been recorded. To seek extra-pair copulation, the male bird invades neighbouring territories and waits at the nest where the female birds were not incubating.[3] The intruding male might coerce a resident female into accepting extra-pair male copulation. Moreover, the aggression of the male bird could act as a deterrent to the female bird, leading to delayed ovulation, allowing the male to re-mate. This increases the likelihood of the male becoming the sole fertiliser of that female's eggs.[3]"}, {"0": "The populations of R. albiscapa in Australia and Tasmania are migratory.

The grey teal has almost identical colouration to the female chestnut teal and the grey can only be distinguished by its lighter coloured neck and paler face. Juveniles are paler than adults, especially on the head. However, they can be identified by a dull brown eye until matured.[4] The bill of the grey teal is a blue-grey colour with dark lining around the edges.

Before breeding season mature birds, both male and female, will undergo a body moult that excludes the wings.[3] Then after breeding season, both partners will undergo a complete body moult (including wings). According to Janet Kear (2005),[4] in Australia the moult of this species is correlated with climate conditions. Indeed during prolonged wet season birds postpone wing moult in order to extend the breeding one \u2013 probably in order to better exploit wetlands resources. This postponement could be explained by the fact that ducks try not to moult and breed at the same time. For some species of birds it is even impossible to do both simultaneously.[5] If we have to draw a tendency we could say that body moult (including wings) generally occurs between the months of January to March when it is late summer or early winter.[3] Juveniles will undergo a complete moult of the entire body other than the wings, occurring in the first autumn or early winter.[3]"}, {"0": "It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda teal, as Anas gibberifrons gracilis."}, {"0": "Widespread throughout its large range, the grey teal is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.[1]"}, {"0": "The grey teal can be found as a breeding species in the following places across the globe; Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and Indonesia.[6] However, it can also be seen in the Solomons and New Caledonia where it is vagrant.[7]"}, {"0": "The grey teal is a self-introduced species to New Zealand from Australia, where it is much more abundant.[8] It was rare in New Zealand until the 1950s when several natural events in Australia led to a huge increase in numbers.

The grey teal also prefers areas that have a sizeable marginal cover (meaning sufficient plant and vegetation growth around the margins),[8] therefore they are not often seen in open spaces. Although it tends to choose freshwater sites during the breeding season, it is also known to be seen in coastal/salt waters occasionally, [4] as well as slightly brackish waters.[9] In terms of elevation the grey teal does not tend to populate in areas above 900\u00a0m (3,000\u00a0ft) above sea level; instead it prefers areas that are below 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) above sea level.[9] When nesting grey teal choose to create their nests amongst vegetation on the ground level, this vegetation may include reeds and tall grasses.[2] They often also elevate nests above ground in tree hollows.[2]"}, {"0": "When establishing a pair-bond, male grey teal will perform a series of displays; some of these include headshakes and head rolls.[3] These displays tend to occur in adolescent birds before breeding season, whereas for mature birds in established pair-bonds courtship rituals are used.[3] This is because grey teal pair-bonds are long term and monogamous,[4] which means they keep the same mate through multiple seasons.

In terms of seasonality, grey teal will tend to breed in the summer-rainfall period.[3] However, they will also breed at any time after a significant amount of rainfall.[4]  Thus, in New Zealand laying occurs between June and September \u201cbut replacement clutches can be laid through to January\u201d.[7] Therefore, their breeding time seldom shows a seasonal pattern.[11]"}, {"0": "Nesting is usually solitary for the grey teal; however, sometimes nesting sites will be close together, meaning breeding pairs may be close to one and other.[3] Nests are often found in tree hollows or hidden amongst vegetation on the ground.[2] The grey teal is not known to construct nests other than using material found from its nesting site:[3] grass and down.[7] Females will create a bowl in the ground that they proceed to fill with litter found around the site as well as surrounding the nest/bowl with down.[3] Between 1-7 eggs will be laid in a nest at a time.[12] Nesting time occurs between the months of June-February in South Australia and slightly later in the area of North Australia [4] due to a slight difference in temperature; whereas in New Zealand grey teal tend to nest between the months of September\u2013November.[4]"}, {"0": "During the incubation period, the male will stand guard and protect the female and eggs while she incubates them for 25\u201331 days.[7]  The clutch (group of eggs) size fluctuates, with an average clutch size being between 6-14 eggs.[3] The laying of each egg is done in approximately 24-hour intervals with laying occurring early in the morning.[3] If a pair loses a brood (amount of chicks hatched at the same time) they will then begin to lay again only after a few weeks. Therefore, some pairs may lay several clutches per season.[3] However, on average the grey teal will lay approximately two broods per season.[3]"}, {"0": "Female grey teal will brood young by themselves, however, when necessary (e.g. death of the female) the male will take over the brooding role and raise the ducklings.[3] Male will also often be present at the later stages of brooding as the female will return to incubate/lay her next clutch.[3] After hatching, parents and broods may remain close to each other for a number of weeks; once the young gains flight it then becomes independent.[3] However, siblings will often stick together for a short amount of time once they have left home.[3]"}, {"0": "Fledging usually occurs between 35 and 40 days.

However, for birds living in a stochastic environment where resources are often temporary (e.g. grey teal Anas gracilis) hormonal control is less likely to allow good exploitation of resources hence allowing the survival of the species.[6] In this type of environment birds have to be able to detect resourceful locations and relocate, meaning they have to move all year round and do not have a migration season."}, {"0": "The grey teal is a great avian nomad that flies long distances. It \u201cis often the exemplar avian nomad in analyses movement and migration\u201d.[6]  Thus, Roshier, D., Asmus, M., from Institute of Land, Water and Society, Charles Sturt University, Australia and Klassen, M., from the Department of Plant-Animal interaction Netherlands Institute, Netherlands, led a study about the long-distance movements of grey teal in Australia. Their goal was to determine what drives these long-distance flights. They found out that 13 out of 32 long-distance movements (> 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi)) recorded were due to rainfall and/or flooding events that occurred up to 1,050\u00a0km (650\u00a0mi) from where the ducks initially were. Thus, it seems that water resources are a major reason in explaining the movements of grey teal. However, some birds moved to other wetlands without clear beneficial reasons. So, according to Roshier, D., Asmus, M., and Klassen, M., there are two types of movements: ranging \u2013 \u201ca search for a place to feed or breed that should stop when the resources being sought are encountered\u201d[13]  \u2013 and directed. Either way, \u201cthese flights occurred over distances up to 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) across the arid inland.\u201d.[6] Thus, grey teal disperse widely throughout the Australian continent due to adaption to environmental change such as flooding, extensive dry periods or lack of food.[6] This process is carried out to seek their preferred environment of shallow wetlands with sufficient food supply and suitable breeding conditions. However, it is uncertain as to whether this behaviour should be referred to as 'migration' or whether a more appropriate term would be 'ranging'.[6] The same applies in New Zealand where the species is very mobile. This flying skill implies that the local population of grey teal changes constantly, both in New Zealand and Australia, which can lead to quick changes in numbers at any locality."}, {"0": "Most animals and birds living within the Northern Hemisphere live in very temperate environments, therefore, cues for migration and movement involve the change in temperature or day length.[13] However, cues for grey teal are believed to be more discrete. Although it is undetermined as to whether grey teal migrate specifically, their movement is triggered by cues such as pressure gradients that occur due to changing weather systems, low-frequency sound/temperature, and visual cues such as lack of food source.[13] As well as this, it is believed that the grey teal uses its sense of smell to move and find suitable wetland environments.[13] Information from tracked grey teal reveals that some flight movements were due to distant thunderstorms occurring.[13] These thunderstorms were hundreds of kilometres away; however, due to their production of low-frequency sound, grey teal could detect this occurrence and move towards the source.[13] Due to Australia being close to the equator, it can become very dry and hot in most places. Therefore, the use of these cues is essential for grey teal to find wetland habitats aiding their survival."}, {"0": "From a study completed by J.A. Mills on the morality and status of grey teal in New Zealand, approximate survival rates were established. To establish the rate of survival, the birds were banded. It was recorded that 68% of juveniles die within the first year of life, 77% by their first two years of life and then 85% by the end of their fourth year.[8] Thus resulting in approximately 0.96 years of expected life for juveniles after they have been banded (age of 2\u20134 months).[8] For grey teal that survive to one year of age, they are expected to have a further 2.9 years of life. For adults, the mean average was 50% of deaths annually, whereas for juveniles it was 68%.[8] Similar results were shown in an Australian study where the mean average of deaths for adults was 52%, and for juveniles 66%.[8] Therefore from the data collected, it can be assumed that the grey teal has an approximate life expectancy of between 2\u20134 years old. However, some exceptions occurred since the oldest adult recorded in the wild in New Zealand was 9 years old.

It constitutes 87-97% of their diet. \nAlthough insects are eaten throughout the year, their part in the diet increases in spring.

Nests are built hanging from thin branches, often in Vachellia drepanolobium, and sometimes in other acacia species such as the umbrella thorn acacia (V. tortilis), blackthorn (Senegalia mellifera) or gum acacia (S. senegal).

In wintertime they eat grass and leaves but also glean grain on cereal stubbles and sometimes feed on growing crops, especially during the night. They have been known to feed on oats, wheat, barley, buckwheat, lentils, peas and root crops. Acorns are sometimes consumed, and on the coast, seagrass (Zostera sp.) may be eaten.[11] In the 1920s in Britain, the pink-footed goose \"discovered\" that potatoes were edible and started feeding on waste potatoes. The greylag followed suit in the 1940s and now regularly searches for tubers on ploughed fields.[14] They also consume small fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs and insects.[20]"}, {"0": "Greylag geese tend to pair bond in long-term monogamous relationships.[21] Most such pairs are probably life-long partnerships, though 5 to 8% of the pairs separate and re-mate with other geese.[21] Birds in heterosexual pairs may engage in promiscuous behavior, despite the opposition of their mates.[21]"}, {"0": "Homosexual pairs are common (14 to 20% of the pairs may be ganders, depending on flock), and share the characteristics of heterosexual pairs with the exceptions that the bonds appear to be closer, based on the intensity of their displays.[21] Same-sex pairs also engage in courtship and sexual relations, and often assume high-ranking positions in the flock as a result of their superior strength and courage, leading some to speculate that they may serve as guardians of the flock.[21] The sexual preference of the birds is generally flexible, as more than half of widowers re-pair with a bird of the opposite sex.[21]"}, {"0": "The nest is on the ground among heather, rushes, dwarf shrubs or reeds, or on a raft of floating vegetation. It is built from pieces of reed, sprigs of heather, grasses and moss, mixed with small feathers and down. A typical clutch is four to six eggs, but fewer eggs or larger numbers are not unusual. The eggs are creamy-white at first but soon become stained, and average 85 by 58 millimetres (3+3\u20448 by 2+5\u204416\u00a0in). They are mostly laid on successive days and incubation starts after the last one is laid. The female does the incubation, which lasts about twenty-eight days, while the male remains on guard somewhere near. The chicks are precocial and able to leave the nest soon after hatching. Both parents are involved in their care and they soon learn to peck at food and become fully-fledged at eight or nine weeks,[11] about the same time as their parents regain their ability to fly after moulting their main wing and tail feathers a month earlier. Immature birds undergo a similar moult, and move to traditional, safe locations before doing so because of their vulnerability while flightless.[18]"}, {"0": "Greylag geese are gregarious birds and form flocks. This has the advantage for the birds that the vigilance of some individuals in the group allows the rest to feed without having to constantly be alert to the approach of predators. After the eggs hatch, some grouping of families occur, enabling the geese to defend their young by their joint actions, such as mobbing or attacking predators.[18] After driving off a predator, a gander will return to its mate and give a \"triumph call\", a resonant honk followed by a low-pitched cackle, uttered with neck extended forward parallel with the ground. The mate and even unfledged young reciprocate in kind.[11]"}, {"0": "Young greylags stay with their parents as a family group, migrating with them in a larger flock, and only dispersing when the adults drive them away from their newly established breeding territory the following year.[19] At least in Europe, patterns of migration are well understood and follow traditional routes with known staging sites and wintering sites. The young learn these locations from their parents which normally stay together for life.[14] Greylags leave their northern breeding areas relatively late in the autumn, for example completing their departure from Iceland by November, and start their return migration as early as January. Birds that breed in Iceland overwinter in the British Isles; those from Central Europe overwinter as far south as Spain and North Africa; others migrate down to the Balkans, Turkey and Iraq for the winter.[22]"}, {"0": "The greylag was once revered across Eurasia. It was linked with the goddess of healing, Gula, a forerunner of the Sumerian fertility goddess Ishtar, in the cities of the Tigris-Euphrates delta over 5,000 years ago.[23] In Ancient Egypt, geese symbolised the sun god Ra. In Ancient Greece and Rome, they were associated with the goddess of love, Aphrodite, and goose fat was used as an aphrodisiac. Since they were sacred birds, they were kept on Rome's Capitoline Hill, from where they raised the alarm when the Gauls attacked in 390 BC.[23]"}, {"0": "The goose's role in fertility survives in modern British tradition in the nursery rhyme Goosey Goosey Gander, which preserves its sexual overtones (\"And in my lady's chamber\"), while \"to goose\" still has a sexual meaning.[23] The tradition of pulling a wishbone derives from the tradition of eating a roast goose at Michaelmas, where the goose bone was once believed to have the powers of an oracle. For that festival, in Thomas Bewick's time, geese were driven in thousand-strong flocks on foot from farms all over the East of England to London's Cheapside market, covering some 13 or 14 kilometres (8 or 9\u00a0mi) per day. Some farmers painted the geese's feet with tar and sand to protect them from road wear as they walked.[23]\nGreylag geese were domesticated by at least 1360\u00a0BC, when images of domesticated birds resembling the eastern race, Anser anser rubirostris (which like modern farmyard geese, but unlike western greylags, have a pink beak) were painted in Ancient Egypt. Goose feathers were used as quill pens, the best being the primary feathers of the left-wing, whose \"curvature bent away from the eyes of right-handed writers\".[24] The feathers also served to fletch arrows.[23] In ethology, the greylag goose was the subject of Konrad Lorenz's pioneering studies of imprinting behaviour.[25]"}, {"0": "Variant with white \"front\""}, {"0": "In flight"}, {"0": "Swimming"}, {"0": "Detail"}, {"0": "ID composite"}, {"0": "Flock taking off over water"}, {"0": "Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden"}, {"0": "Female with chicks"}, {"0": "On Texel, Netherlands"}, {"0": "In Ystad"}, {"0": "Full body"}, {"0": "The grey-legged tinamou (Crypturellus duidae), alternatively, the gray-legged tinamou, is a small ground-dwelling bird endemic to the neotropics.

from a bird collected at the base of Mount Cameroon near Limbe, Cameroon.[3] He published his description in Ornithologische Monatsberichte and described it as Picathartes oreas.[4] The generic name was first used by Ren\u00e9-Primev\u00e8re Lesson in 1828 after he split the grey-necked rockfowl's close relative the white-necked rockfowl from the crow genus Corvus and placed it in its own genus, Picathartes, as the white-necked rockfowl did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head.[5] This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for \"magpie\" and cathartes for \"vulture\".[6][7] The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek word oreas, meaning \"mountain\".[8] Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), babblers (Timaliidae) and Old World warblers (Sylviidae).[9] Today the grey-necked rockfowl and the white-necked rockfowl are believed to comprise a unique family, Picathartidae.[10] Additionally, it has been suggested, though not generally accepted, that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order.[3] Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and south-east Asia's rail-babbler, form a clade.[11] The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44\u00a0million years ago.[11] It is believed that the ancestor of this clade

two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May.[30] In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.[29]"}, {"0": "This rockfowl builds its nest onto the sides of rocks, normally in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest.[23] Nests need to be built under an overhang to protect it from water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly.[15] The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools.[29] These streams, particularly those located at the base of a nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests.[21] Nests on rock surfaces are normally built 1.2 to 5.2 metres (3.9 to 17.1\u00a0ft) above the ground.[23] In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream.[15] Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's Lop\u00e9 National Park.[31] The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year.[23] The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest's walls.[23] It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure.[23] Nests are built at least away 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) from each other, and in some cases up to 5 metres (16\u00a0ft).[29] The nest is normally 30 to 40 centimetres (12 to 16\u00a0in) thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was 140 centimetres (55\u00a0in) thick.[23] It is about 290 centimetres (110\u00a0in) wide and 400 centimetres (160\u00a0in) long and weighs about 3 kilograms (6.6\u00a0lb).[23] However, nest sizes do have a large degree of variability.[20] After the mud dries, it becomes a very hard structure.[23] The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass.[23]"}, {"0": "One to three eggs, normally two, are laid, with the second egg being laid between 24 and 48\u00a0hours after the first.[21] The eggs are variable in coloration and can be a light yellow-brown with dark brown blotches, creamy white with dark brown or grey blotches, or pale grey with brown mottling.[23] The eggs weigh about 15.2 grams (0.54\u00a0oz) and have an average size of 40.5 millimetres (1.59\u00a0in) by 27.5 millimetres (1.08\u00a0in).[30] The rockfowl begins to incubate after both eggs are laid.[20] The time the rockfowl spends incubating varies greatly, though it is mostly for less than five minutes at a time with nearly two hours between sessions.[30] Both the male and female rockfowl incubate.[20] When the incubating bird's mate comes, it gives a brief call that causes the incubating bird to leave the nest.[30] In the two days prior to hatching, the adult rockfowl prods at the eggs, sometimes with food in its beak.[30] Incubation lasts for 21 to 24 days.[30] When the infants hatch, they hatch about a day apart.[30] The adult rockfowl quickly remove the eggshell fragments from the nest.[30] The newborn weighs only 12 grams (0.42\u00a0oz) after hatching, but it quickly gains weight.[30] The eyes open and the tail begins to grow on the fifth day.[20] During the first couple of days, food is brought to the nestlings three to six times an hour, peaking in the evening.[22][29] Begging nestlings expose their beak and gape to their parent, though they do not make a sound.[29] The second-hatched nestling often fails to gain weight and dies, and there is evidence suggesting that the adults cannibalize the remains.[30] For the first ten days after hatching, one adult rockfowl stays and guards the nestlings while the other collects food; despite this, nests have been destroyed by chimpanzees and drills.[3][30] The chicks leave the nest after 24 days.[20] Infanticide has been recorded in this species, with rockfowl killing other rockfowl's young.[32] In one case, a second pair of rockfowl moved onto a nest after killing the first pair's nestlings.[22]"}, {"0": "In Cameroon, the grey-necked rockfowl is respected by the indigenous peoples and, in some cases, even feared.[3] It is known by many names to the indigenous peoples of Nigeria, with most of the translating to \"bird of the rocks\" or \"fowl of the stream\".[33] Hunters sheltering in the rockfowl's nesting caves have been known to kill and eat adult rockfowl, though it is generally thought to be too small to eat and is left for children to hunt.[30][33] In the 1950s and 1960s, western zoos desired this species, leading to a large demand to collect the rockfowl for display.[34] British conservationist and author Gerald Durrell made this species a target on two of his trips to Cameroon, which he describes in The Bafut Beagles and A Zoo in My Luggage.[6] The trade of this species is non-existent today, and, as the zoo population did not sustain itself despite sporadic breeding, the last captive rockfowl died at the Frankfurt Zoo in 2009.[26][34] The grey-necked rockfowl has been depicted on numerous postage stamps from Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as stamps from Benin and Togo, where it does not live.[35] It is considered one of the most difficult species of bird to see in the wild.[12] The grey-necked rockfowl is a symbol for both conservation and ecotourism efforts in its range.[34] This species is considered one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by ornithologists.[36]"}, {"0": "The grey-necked rockfowl is considered to be vulnerable due to habitat destruction, its isolated populations, collection of adults, predation, and a low breeding success rate.[3] Its habitat is being destroyed to create large agricultural fields and cocoa plantations, as well as for logging and slash-and-burn agriculture.[21] Due to the highly specialized requirements for its habitat, its population is very fragmented, and the species is believed to be naturally rare.[29] Competition for its nesting sites is a result of these strict requirements and can lead to infanticide.[22] Its estimated population is between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, though it is believed that the population is at the lower end of the estimate.[21] However, due to the inaccessibility of some parts of its range, it is also possible that this species is more common than believed.[34] The population of some of these colonies is reaching the minimum levels needed for long-term viability.[3] It also falls victim to spring traps set for mammals by hunters.[21] However, a more serious threat to its numbers was the widespread collection of rockfowl for display in zoos in the 1950s and 1960s.[34] There is a risk that it will be negatively affected by ecotourism due to disturbances in its daily routine if proper viewing procedures are not followed.[21]"}, {"0": "Cameroon is the only nation with a national law protecting this species.[3] This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can be captured with a proper permit.[21] International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under CITES Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances.[34] In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species.[3] This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.[3]"}, {"0": "This rockfowl is protected in some of the areas in which it lives by national parks.[3] Additionally, there

There is also a specific pterygoid bone in Picidae compared to other birds.[23] They have a specific cancellous tissue between the skull and the beak, with a displacement of the attachment of the greater horn of the hyoid bone to the quadrate bone, as well as a reinforced sternum and keel. These elements maximize energy dissipation and shock absorption for the bird during impact.[22] The specific, long tongue of the Picidae is cylindrical and is about twice the size of its bill. The tongue is the result of an evolution of the hyoid apparatus with two parts; one bony at the end is equipped with small hooks, the other cartilaginous lengthens under the action of a branchiomandibular muscle that attaches to the branch of the mandible, split, anchoring on the anterior part at the base of the culmen, surrounding the skull from behind with its two branches, descending on either side of the spine, esophagus and larynx, which pushes the hyoid horns and tongue out of the beak.[22]"}, {"0": "Juvenile birds are similar to adults but have duller, dark brown plumage.[2] The life expectancy of individuals is greater than five years[24] and estimated to be between eight and ten years.[4]"}, {"0": "The adult Guadeloupe woodpecker feeds mainly on termites, ants, larvae, myriapods, and arthropods\u201490 percent of which are collected when piercing dead wood\u2014[25] and fruits.[5] Due to the difference in the size of their beaks, males preferentially seek their prey on large branches and dead trunks while females more frequently attach themselves to branches, especially those with small cross-sections.[25] Scientific studies of a captive woodpecker have shown the tip of the bird's long tongue has horny, backward-facing, saliva-coated hooks that allow it to grasp and extract insects from deep holes in wood rather than \"harpooning\" them.[22][26]"}, {"0": "It has been reported the Guadeloupe woodpecker may occasionally and opportunistically feed on a small lizards (Anolis marmoratus), which are also endemic to the archipelago.[27] Female woodpeckers may occasionally consume crab carcasses during the breeding season to obtain the calcium necessary for the production of their eggshells.[25]"}, {"0": "No precise studies of woodpecker feeding, such as identification and quantity of insects consumed, in adults could be made because of the speed of their prey consumption.[25] During the nesting period, however, studies have shown the typical diet of nestlings\u2014brought by the parents at a rate of five times per hour\u2014mainly consists of large prey ranging from 20\u201340\u00a0mm (0.79\u20131.57\u00a0in) with an average of 20\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in).

Males usually take dominance of an area on the ground, although sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a \u201ccourt\u201d. Quality of courts are known to have some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center of activity in the lek. The reason for the focus on the center of activity in the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas.[5] Guianan courts are commonly found in the Guianan Shield, a forested region in northeastern South America.[6]"}, {"0": "The diet of the adult Guianan cock-of-the-rock consists mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous. Up to 65 species of fruit have been reported in their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit.[7] In British Guiana, E. Thomas. Gilliard found papayas growing at the base of a huge rock. On top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing in that part of the forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting.[8]\nSmall snakes, lizards, insects and frogs are occasionally found in its diet.[7] By selectively feeding on nearby fruit trees and then defecating or regurgitating the seeds within the leks, these birds can actively influence the regeneration and succession of the forest habitat where they breed.[9]"}, {"0": "Guianan cocks-of-the-rock breed early in the year, and the females lay their eggs around March, nesting in rocky areas.[10] During the height of mating season, males gather in leks with multiple males defending a social display arena of much greater area than that of a lone male.[10] The males each have their own area on the forest floor where they make their courts. The size of each court is about 1 metre (3\u00a0ft) in diameter, and the next bird is often about 3 metres (10\u00a0ft) away.[5] The females and males live separately; only when it is time to mate do females fly over to observe and choose a male. When this occurs, the females tap the males from behind and insemination quickly follows. When females approach a lek, the males stand firmly and present themselves rigidly.[5][11]"}, {"0": "Mating success is dependent on a variety of factors that range from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the-rock displayed sexual selection based on sequential comparisons or threshold standards. The hens engaged in a \u201cpool\u2013comparison\u201d tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males.[5] The females in the study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger, more centrally concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice.[3]"}, {"0": "Unlike other species of the family Cotingidae, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves rather than in the trees.[6] The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and plant material, which is attached by saliva to a vertical rock. The female takes care of the building and maintenance of the nest, the incubation of the eggs and the parenting. The male does not participate at all. Eggs typically incubate for 27\u201328 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins.[10]"}, {"0": "The smaller of the two cocks-of-the-rock, the male Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is polygynous and has nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off his magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females.[12][13]"}, {"0": "The displaying male purposely contrasts himself from the forest, shows his crest and plumage so much that the bill and tail become obscured; almost making him difficult to recognize as a bird, to attract females.[5][11] Within the lek, each female has her own perch on a low branch,  while the males own a \"court\" on the ground below that is cleared of dead leaves by the draughts of each male taking off and landing. The males have a variety of calls and movements, showing off the crest, elongated filaments on the rump, secondary feathers, and the snapping of their bills.[12][13] Males display on branches about 2.5 metres (8.2\u00a0ft) from the ground until a female approaches, when the males display and call from individual plots on the ground.[14] Most males copulate with only a few females. However, some are very successful and may copulate with many. Unlike many other bird species, the male does not use resources nor parental care to entice females.[15]"}, {"0": "Males often engage in courtship disruption practices. In a study conducted by Pepper W. Trail, the interactions between adult males, females, and yearlings were observed and linked to mate choice and male dispersion patterns within leks. Adult males produced this disruptive behaviour with varying intensity, which depended on the situation.  In lower-intensity disruptions, males usually directed their aggression or threats towards neighboring males, in attempts to improve or maintain breeding status and success. The males that were hassled tended to be more successful and often were disrupted with much greater frequency than males with lower mating success. Higher-intensity disruptions were used by less successful males and directed towards females that wandered by. This behaviour is suggested to have the effect of redirecting females towards the hassling male. Yearlings often disrupted courtships of the more mature adults on the basis of practice for future courtships, since the yearlings do not possess any territory within the lek. Female disruption was an uncommon event that had little, if any, effect on the accessibility of a male. Young males of highly promiscuous species such as the Cock-of-the rock often failed to mate in their first year, probably because older, more experienced males will enjoy the majority of matings. In this strong system of sexual selection, the successive breeding of dominant and aggressive males leads to high sex drives and the endurance of polygyny. A theory suggests that the selection of these aggressive males also puts a premium, or value, on female characteristics. Hence, there is a less likely occurrence of female\u2013elicited aggression.[16][17]"}, {"0": "Male Guianan cock-of-the-rock \"delight in homosexuality\" with almost 40 percent engaging in a form of homosexual activity and a small percentage never copulating with females.[18][19]"}, {"0": "One possible advantage to lek formation (in Guianan cock-of-the-rock and other species) is severe selection and consequent rapid evolutionary advancement, all of which is possible due to the high expendability of males. Only a few males are needed to fertilize the next generation.  The courtship behaviour is similarly theorized to have arisen from differences in division of labour between the two sexes. Females expend their energy on building nests and rearing young, while males spend most of their time and energy of finding mates and caring for their plumage.[20]"}, {"0": "Guianan cocks-of-the-rock form large leks, averaging 55 adult males. The males in these display leks were especially vulnerable to attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, due to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks and the size of leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to flush or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.[21]"}, {"0": "There is speculation that the simulation of male-male competition is important in lek formation and breeding.[22]"}, {"0": "The colouration of the males allows them to visibly stand out from the brown forest floor. This bright colouration provides a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating. The result is rapid evolutionary selection within the species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in the males. The bright colouration also makes the males more susceptible to predation. Males are more expendable for this reason; only a small number of males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate the species. While sexual selection leads to bright plumage, natural selection in turn favors defensive colouration in the birds. There is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose colouration acts as camouflage-protection from predation.[20]"}, {"0": "Fairly common in its large range, and with its population stable, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a Least Concern on its red list of threatened species.[1]"}, {"0": "The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, black-and-white hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles and slaty-backed forest falcons.

When demand for gyrfalcons exceeded supply, the Liao Emperor imposed a tax payment-in-kind of gyrfalcons on the Jurchen; under the last Liao emperor, tax collectors were entitled to use force to procure sufficient gyrfalcons. This was one cause of the Jurchen rebellion, whose leader Aguda annihilated the Liao empire in 1125, and established the Jin dynasty in its stead.[36]"}, {"0": "Most historians agree that the coat of arms of Ukraine, the medieval symbol, was not intended to depict a trident, but most likely a stylized falcon. Depictions of a flying falcon with a cross above its head have been found in Old Ladoga, the first seat of Kievan Rurik dynasty,[37] of Scandinavian lineage.[38] For centuries falconry has been a royal sport in Europe. Also known also as the Norwegian falcon, it was considered a royal bird and is mentioned (uk: \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442) in one of the earliest epics of Ruthenia, the 12th century poem The Tale of Igor's Campaign. The gyrfalcon is related to other falcons. Falcons are known to be very susceptible to avian influenza. Therefore, an experiment was done with hybrid gyr-saker falcons, which found that five falcons vaccinated with a commercial H5N2 influenza vaccine survived infection with a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, whereas five unvaccinated falcons died. Thus, both wild and captive gyrfalcons can be protected from bird flu by vaccination.[39]"}]
